There’s a good chance that you enrolled in this certificate program hoping to find work as a UX designer in the near future. UX design is a rapidly changing field with a projected 10-year growth rate of 15% (Burning Glass, 2020). When you check out most job searching sites, you’ll find tens of thousands of job postings for UX-related roles. In fact, recruiters around the world are struggling to fill open positions for UX designers because the demand for people with these skills is outpacing the supply of available UX designers. That’s where you come in. 

While it might be a little early to begin searching for jobs, it’s important context to know that “UX designer” is just one of many job titles within the broader user experience field. As you continue with this certificate program, you might become interested in a certain specialty or career path within the field. In addition, as an entry-level UX designer, you will likely work alongside other UX professionals with various areas of expertise. To help you get started, this reading will explore a handful of different careers within the field of user experience.

![Icon showing two smart phone screens with a green arrow pointing between them, text underneath reads "Interaction Designer".](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/VPqkxwvoS826pMcL6NvNSQ_265b6b747e454313903117958e90274c_UXD_C1_M1_L1_R2_B.png?expiry=1727654400000&hmac=MiZNzjs42je6GFygKFN-67ih0YQVvE4iwmgFb9KBJa8)

Interaction designers focus on designing the experience of a product and how it functions. They strive to understand the user flow, or the path, that a typical user takes to complete a task on an app, website, or other platform. At Google and many other companies, interaction designers are a specialized type of UX designer.

An interaction designer's work answers questions like: What should happen if a user taps on this button? How do we make this action easier for users to complete? And, how are the design elements within the website laid out? Interaction designers focus less on how the product looks and instead strive to make the product easy to navigate and simple for users to interact with.

![Icon showing a cell phone screen and color swatches, with "Visual Designer" in text underneath.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/en8FClFzRgO_BQpRc5YDUQ_695ce10ecedc4189a68583195f6e5488_UXD_C1_M1_L1_R2_A.png?expiry=1727654400000&hmac=l234WxHZCeRu0-Rn3wSwIKIPZsfhjuzwbQNLUgN9EA8)

Visual designers focus on how a product or technology looks. They are often responsible for designing logos, illustrations, and icons, as well as deciding on font color, size, and placement. Visual designers focus on the layout of each page or screen and make all of the design elements fit together in a visually appealing way. At Google and many other companies, visual designers are a specialized type of UX designer.

The role of a visual designer is to answer questions like: What kind of visual style should icons have, in order to fit the product's branding? Or, which color and font should we use for this button? The goal of a visual designer is to delight users with designs that inspire, engage, and excite them.

![Icon shows a computer screen with a video play button and primary colors, text underneath reads "Motion Designer".](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/iIXp_FhtR7aF6fxYbQe2xw_4deaa2c2b1294307a517a6610c4286d7_UXD_C1_M1_L1_R2_C.png?expiry=1727654400000&hmac=LtaOglWHsK8rPGCgIL2OCQrmx_NfIpMzoUglPF9saQE)

Motion designers think about what it feels like for a user to move through a product and how to create smooth transitions between pages on an app or website. They may also create animations or visual effects to bring their design ideas to life. At Google and many other companies, motion designers are a specialized type of UX designer.

A motion designer’s work answers questions like: How should an app transition between pages? How do we show the connection between these actions? And, what’s an engaging animation that will help tell our story? Motion designers focus on design elements that move, rather than traditional static designs.

![Graphic of a VR/AR headset and a pen, text underneath reads "VR/AR designer".](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/6BCNA_bJQ-KQjQP2ySPibg_e812f88809f44ffdb065cef257355340_UXD_C1_M1_L1_R2_D.png?expiry=1727654400000&hmac=zGOsGgwaQC8kaGCr7zlZ59yUwIgdgkvrIOMz12IjKPs)

Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) designers create products that provide users with immersive experiences, unbounded by the limits of the physical world. **Virtual reality** involves a wearable headset that takes over a user’s vision; it blocks out their physical surroundings and immerses them in a completely virtual world. For example, VR can feel like you're entering the setting of a magical imaginary land.

On the other hand, **augmented reality** uses the physical world as a backdrop and adds virtual elements on top of it. Users are still contextually aware of their surroundings, but their reality is augmented, or enhanced, by adding elements through a screen. For example, you can sit in your actual kitchen, and an AR experience can add digital images, like a new barstool or a piece of artwork, to the room around you.

A VR or AR designer’s work answers questions like: How do we create a user experience that leverages 3D space? Or, will this action cause a user motion sickness? To ensure users are comfortable immersing in a VR or AR experience, designers need to carefully consider everything from sound to lighting. 

![Tablet screen with a webpage shown, icon of a red magnifying glass overlayed. Text underneath reads "UX researcher".](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/Dd6949o4Si6evePaOJouXg_cc971020bd9149b8be96ba563285a240_UXD_C1_M1_L1_R2_E.png?expiry=1727654400000&hmac=8saB9D7wWsFx1mS7wb3ltYQaBvA40JboiXYoGiR_seQ)

UX researchers conduct studies or interviews that examine how people use a product. UX researchers often identify pain points that users are experiencing and explore how products can help solve those problems. They also explore the usability of existing products, by asking users to complete tasks in an app or website, for example.

UX researchers answer questions like: What problems are users facing? Is the design of this product easy to use? And, would people be interested in this new design feature? The goal of UX researchers is often to understand how a product can provide a solution to a real problem users are having.

![Webpage with text is show, with a pencil overlaid. Text underneath reads "UX Writer".](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/yizqA_1rSkWs6gP9aypFzw_be188c63a68d4cc688673f16920375e1_UXD_C1_M1_L1_R2_F.png?expiry=1727654400000&hmac=BKjKjFoYlpEHS0nVliWMUgCmdKBRkdHw1LU7ctjEueM)

UX writers think about how to make the language within a product clearer so that the user experience is more intuitive. UX writers also help define a brand’s voice and personality. The work of UX writers often includes writing labels for buttons and determining the tone of language used within an app or website.

UX writers focus on answering questions like: What words should be used to communicate this idea clearly? Should the tone for this app be friendly or technical? And, what should the language on this button label say? UX writers often become subject matter experts in order to present content that’s easy to understand for all users.

![Icon of a person, a piece of paper, and an arrow in all in a circle. Text underneath reads "UX program manager".](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/HzlGTqwgSi-5Rk6sIEovBQ_f89f7a8bcb074947be2d65efd2550489_UXD_C1_M1_L1_R2_G.png?expiry=1727654400000&hmac=R5Kx29Tvop5xwsCDbrrnZTl3tETMXykWCMEKTkgnXOU)

UX program managers ensure clear and timely communication, so that the process of building a useful product moves smoothly from start to finish. This might include setting goals, writing project plans, and allocating team resources.

UX program managers answer questions like: What are the overall goals for this project, and what’s the plan to achieve them? And, how can we create and improve processes within the team? UX program managers work across departments to make sure that UX is involved throughout a project lifecycle.

![Icon of coding language and a smart phone, with text underneath that reads "UX engineer".](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/z0JLW4mBQiuCS1uJgcIrAA_68301c7d62764a5eb45515f4ddd981ef_UXD_C1_M1_L1_R2_H.png?expiry=1727654400000&hmac=T-OVuBGUW-tA8Ab2hAOwLnJ6fneVkfRyYuukWPSpNcI)

UX engineers translate the design’s intent into a functioning experience, like an app or a website. They help UX teams figure out if designs are intuitive and technically feasible.

UX engineers answer questions like: How do we implement each interaction? How do we build this design in a way that stays true to its original intent? And, how might we explore alternatives to determine the best user experience? UX engineers synthesize design and development, bringing product concepts to life. 

![Icon of a bot and two speech bubbles above, with text underneath that reads "Conversation designer".](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/mrhBGkynRLa4QRpMp1S2Pg_2aac22bbd04149dd8bed545539a52c7e_Screen-Shot-2021-04-13-at-4.01.57-AM.png?expiry=1727654400000&hmac=7BwZQ71YToBTVQcwAWqxvikMwhoCjjW3NJ1LvjO_sUI)

Conversational interfaces are everywhere, from intelligent virtual assistants like Google Assistant and Siri, to interactive voice response systems like customer service systems you can talk to. Conversational interfaces even include automobile navigation systems and chatbots! Conversation design incorporates natural, real-world conversational behaviors into the interactions between users and these systems.

Conversation designers make it possible for users to have natural conversations to get things done. They leverage user research, psychology, technical knowledge, and linguistics to create user experiences that are intuitive and engaging. Conversation designers develop the “persona” or personality of the voice, as well as the flow and dialog of the interaction. 

Conversation designers answer questions like: What’s the ideal language and flow based on who users are, the task to be accomplished, and the context of the conversation? Does the personality of the virtual assistant seem genuine, engaging, and reflective of the brand values? How does the conversation work with on-screen elements? Does the virtual assistant offer a consistent, usable, and useful experience end-to-end?

# Most common UX tools

## **Evolution of UX tools**

The field of UX design and the tools used by designers have evolved over the last several years. Initially, UX designers commonly used Adobe Creative Suite tools, such as Photoshop. These tools were used mostly for print and static design. But, as technology and the demands for UX design evolved, so did the need for increased functionality of digital tools. [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) was released in 2010 and was the first digital-forward design tool built specifically for UX designers. In addition, more tools like [Freehand](https://www.freehandapp.com/) by Miro, released in 2011, and [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io/), released in 2015, came along, offering prototype capabilities and opportunities for easier collaboration.

As organizations have continued to digitally transform and move towards dynamic work environments, UX tools have had to keep pace. The increase in remote workers, along with dynamic work environments, has presented a need for UX designers to find the right-sized toolset to fit their desired output. 

Today, the demand for modern, digitally collaborative tools has not subsided. [Figma](https://www.figma.com/about/) and [Adobe XD](https://helpx.adobe.com/support/xd.html) both took center stage in the UX design world when they were released in 2016. Today, Figma holds one of the biggest stakes in the collaborative design and prototyping market. It offers real-time collaboration, Dev Mode for engineers, and in-product prototyping features, in addition to many custom plug-ins for unique design needs. Adobe XD continues to offer a robust solution for UX designers as well, with features such as cloud syncing, for example, for distributed digital teams. These features facilitate a collaborative element, for teams who are not working in face-to-face environments.  

## **Going forward**

Most of the modern UX tools used by UX designers have similar functionality, with some unique features and robust online learning libraries. You will likely use more than one design tool throughout your career. However, in this certificate program, the focus will be on Figma. You’ll learn how to use it, and you’ll work on projects you’ll be able to include in your UX design portfolio. 

## **Considerations when choosing UX tools** 

Don’t worry - you don’t have to choose a UX tool today! But, at some point in the future, as you dive deeper into your UX design career, you’ll want to choose UX tools that work best for you and the specific projects you’re working on. As you gain a better understanding of UX design and the UX design tools, there are a few things you’ll want to consider when selecting a UX tool:

### **Who you are as a designer**

You may end up pursuing a job as a UX designer. Or, you may end up in a role that is a variation of UX design—for example, a visual designer or a motion designer. You learned about various UX design jobs in [Jobs in the field of user experience.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-user-experience-design/lecture/0yONp/jobs-in-the-field-of-user-experience) Understanding what UX tools work best for you will ultimately be informed by the role you take on and the corresponding responsibilities and job tasks.

### **The design context**

Another consideration for choosing a UX tool will be the design context in which you work. In some cases, the organization may dictate the tool you use simply based on what it already uses. Or, you may have the flexibility to decide on the tool based on the type of project you are working on or the level of collaboration among team members you may need. These are just a few factors that may influence the type of UX tool you choose. 

### **Capabilities of the tool**

When you get to the point of choosing a UX tool, you’ll also need to consider the capabilities of the tool. You’ll learn more about these capabilities later in this certificate program. Going forward, you’ll investigate the tool and ask questions such as:

- Does it allow for mobile-responsive design? 
    
    - For example: You may create templates and layouts for various devices. Does the tool account for, and adapt to, different screen sizes? 
        
- Does it allow for prototyping, testing, and reviewing? 
    
    - For example: You’ll eventually want to build a prototype, or sample, of a product. Does the tool allow you to build the prototype? Does it allow you to test how it works? And, can the tool allow other stakeholders or designers to review it and provide feedback directly into the tool?
        
- Does it allow for team collaboration?
    
    - For example: You will likely work on a team with several people. Can each team member work in the tool? Can revisions or suggestions be made by other team members? 
        
- Does it allow for a centralized design system?
    
    - For example: You likely won’t be the only designer on a project. With multiple team members and collaborators, consistency is key. Does the tool allow the team to view and/or copy styles and properties to ensure consistency across the project?
        

## **UX tools—an overview**  

In this certificate, you’ll focus on Figma. Figma is one of the preeminent UX tools. There are other UX tools, mentioned previously, you can look at for comparison. 

### Sketch, Freehand, and Zeppelin

- Work well with very large teams that may struggle to adopt new tools
    
- Paired most commonly with another of these tools
    
- Do not require WIFI, enabling offline design work
    
- Do not afford real-time collaboration, prototyping, or design to development collaborative activities
    

### **Adobe XD**

- Works well with teams that already use Adobe’s Suite
    
- Rounds out Adobe’s suite of products with one that is entirely built for digital and UX design work
    
- Syncs to Cloud rather than using actual real-time collaboration and can be used offline
    

### **Figma**

- Is excellent for most designers and contexts
    
- Includes Fig Jam access, a whiteboard for brainstorming, diagramming, and strategizing
    
- Requires WIFI connection
    
- Is a digital-first, remote-friendly, all-in-one tool, allowing for easier sharing, designing, collaboration, and reviewing in our ever-changing, more virtual workspace 
    

## **Do your research**

Check out each tool’s website for additional information. As you educate yourself on each tool’s features and benefits, you’ll be able to choose the UX tool that is right for you. But remember: You’ll be introduced to Figma and you’ll learn how to use it throughout this certification course.

# development life cycle

Every new product, whether it’s an app or a physical object, follows a specific set of steps that take it from the first spark of an idea to the release of the final product. This is called the **product development life cycle**, and it has five stages: **brainstorm**, **define**, **design**, **test**, and **launch**. Depending on where you work, the exact names of each stage might be a little different, but the overall process is generally the same.

![graphic showing the product development lifecycle (represented by a circle)](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/7r-T1J09Sy6_k9SdPbsuXA_98483f0b053e4b7696bd9f02c59b3fdd_Screen-Shot-2021-03-02-at-2.05.20-PM.png?expiry=1727654400000&hmac=pj0ID1pXFRbogxFeiU6MoeF7nf1VWHhA6YetPmrHjKI)

Around the circle there are icons for each phase of the lifecycle - brainstorm, define, design, test, launch

In this reading, you’ll explore the product development life cycle and how UX design fits into each stage. As you might have guessed, UX designers are most engaged during the _design_ stage of the product development life cycle, but they work closely with team members — like researchers, product managers, and engineers — throughout the entire life cycle. 

As a product moves through the development life cycle, the team might need to spend longer working in one stage than in others, or repeat certain stages based on feedback. The success of each stage depends on the previous stage’s completion, so it’s important to do them in order. 

Check out each of the five stages of the product development life cycle!

![Subheading - Brainstorm](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/b6LLv7piROOiy7-6YsTj2w_0966b00821154afc92c4f3ec75158f45_UXD_C1_M1_L1_R1_B.png?expiry=1727654400000&hmac=mkZld2NY30lYQ3xfT6akIljVLPvPniwDskvbQ9e7Fko)

The first stage of the product development life cycle is the **brainstorm** stage, when the team starts thinking of an idea for a product. Your team might already know the user problem that you want to solve when you begin the product development life cycle. If not, coming up with a list of user problems is a great place to start.

It’s important to pay attention to the diversity of your team at this stage. Teams that have meaningful diversity across identifiers like race, gender, abilities, family structure, age, and ethnicity are generally more effective at brainstorming because they bring together a lot of different lived experiences. 

Consider this example: If you’re designing a new app to help working parents and guardians, your team might start the brainstorming stage by listing common problems that working parents and guardians face, like a lack of reliable childcare, transportation concerns, or trouble managing schedules. Your team might review user feedback about other similar products or the results of user surveys to help guide your ideas. After you’ve brainstormed lots of user problems, your team chooses one and starts coming up with ideas for solutions to that problem. 

The brainstorm stage is also an ideal time to check out your product's competitors and identify if there are already similar products available in the market. You want your product to fill a gap in the market or solve a problem better than existing products. Completing research into both your competitors and your users helps determine what problems need to be addressed by the product’s design.

One more thing to keep in mind: A UX designer at a large company might not be very involved in the brainstorm stage. But a UX designer at a startup or small business could have a big role to play!

![Subheading - Define](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/JW9qDQaTRXavag0Gk3V2fw_893f78fc26cd459089ee13c66073661f_UXD_C1_M1_L1_R1_C.png?expiry=1727654400000&hmac=Tw0mKsJ4gMI-wnLMBlxe5t1V4USuKYWKaOg13aFqm5s)

The second stage of the product development life cycle brings together UX designers, UX researchers, program managers, and product leads to **define** the product. The goal is to figure out the specifications for the product by answering questions like: Who is the product for? What will the product do? And, what features need to be included for the product to be successful? 

During the define stage, your team narrows the focus of your idea. One product can’t solve every user problem. Continuing with the example for an app to help working parents and guardians, your idea should focus on helping parents and guardians find reliable childcare _or_ manage their schedules, not both. In this stage, a UX designer might help the team pin down the focus of the idea, but a product lead will probably be the one to define the scope of the project. 

The research you completed in the brainstorm stage comes in handy now. Using what you've learned, you will pinpoint your potential users’ problems. Your team can’t assume they know what problems users are experiencing without asking the users directly.

![Subheading - Design](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/_bCk6KP5TW-wpOij-S1vqw_1d4a77fa8cac441eae103bdb019c62c5_UXD_C1_M1_L1_R1_D.png?expiry=1727654400000&hmac=aOsGcbgceLeb6enE6ZPc0mltJflhjmS9rpCbMwQBhmM)

The third stage of the product development life cycle is **design**. At this stage, UX designers develop the ideas for the product. Generally, UX designers start by drawing wireframes, which are outlines or sketches of the product, then move on to creating prototypes, which are early models of a product that convey its functionality.

UX writers are also involved in the design stage and might do things like write button labels or other copy within the product's wireframes and prototypes.

At this point in the life cycle, UX designers make sure to include all of the product specifications that were outlined in the define stage. You might also check to ensure that each part of the design fits together in an intuitive way. For example, UX designers might check that the screens of an app flow in a way that makes sense to the user. Or that each interaction, like tapping a button, has a correlating action, like an item getting added to a cart. On the other hand, with a physical product, UX designers might check that one piece of a physical object matches up to the connecting piece. Finally, UX designers also make sure that each task a user needs to complete is clear and easy to understand, like navigating from the homepage to the checkout confirmation page in an app.

![Subheading - Test](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/WSGPH4cXQXKhjx-HF3Fyig_031f790d43bd47d18f6666ae45ba0794_UXD_C1_M1_L1_R1_E.png?expiry=1727654400000&hmac=IgAeNg_AbQvGDstfoUGYuNd98GhQyA4TBfaZtTGGNZQ)

Next, your designs move into the **test** stage. UX designers work with engineers to develop functional prototypes that match the original designs, including details and features that fit the company’s brand, like font and color choices. This also means writing the code and finalizing the overall structure of the product. 

Or, if you want to test your designs earlier, another option is to test a functioning prototype of the product, using a design tool like Figma or Adobe XD. You'll learn how to create prototypes of your designs later in the certificate program.

At this stage, the designs go through at least three phases of testing: internal tests within your company, reviews with stakeholders, and external tests with potential users. A **stakeholder** is a person you need to work with to complete the project or anyone who has some interest in the project, either within or outside of the company.

Running these tests is typically the responsibility of the UX researcher on your team, if you have one. 

- First, the team **tests the product internally** to look for technical glitches and usability problems. This is often referred to as alpha testing.
    
- Then, the product undergoes a **test with stakeholders** to make sure the product is aligned with the company’s vision, meets legal guidelines for accessibility, and follows government regulations for privacy, for example.
    
- Finally, there’s an **external test with potential users**. This is the time to figure out whether the product provides a good user experience, meaning it’s usable, equitable, enjoyable, and useful. This is often referred to as beta testing.
    

Gathering and implementing feedback at this stage is absolutely critical. If users are frustrated or confused by your product, UX designers make adjustments or even create new versions of the design. Then, the designs are tested again, until there’s little or no friction between the product and the user.

It’s important to call out that the product development life cycle isn’t a completely linear process. Your team might cycle between designing and testing a few times before you're ready to launch the product!

![Subheading - Launch](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/YVXYd0K-SOiV2HdCvnjoRQ_35ab9da5a06c4177b264637d8419eee5_UXD_C1_M1_L1_R1_F.png?expiry=1727654400000&hmac=jDFaEV0M6a77tnViJx2ZFy6IbqYvsbpTH0QTxXKqLYM)

Finally, you’ve arrived at the fifth and final stage of the product development cycle: the **launch** stage, when the product is released into the world! This might involve listing an app in the Google Play Store or Apple’s App Store, making a website go live, or putting a physical product on store shelves. 

The launch stage is a time to celebrate your work and start promoting the product. Marketing professionals on your team might post about the new product on social media or publish a press release. The customer support team might get ready to help new users learn how the product works. 

Program managers also meet with the cross-functional team to reflect on the entire product development life cycle and ask questions like: What worked and what could be improved? Were goals achieved? Were timelines met? Making time for this reflection is super important, since it can help improve the process going forward. 

For a physical product, the launch stage might be the end of the product development life cycle. But for a digital product, like an app or website, launching the product to a wider audience provides another opportunity to improve on the user experience. New users might find problems with the product’s functionality or features to improve that no one noticed before. So, after the launch stage, teams will often cycle back to the design and testing stages to start working on the next version of a digital product.

## Beyond the product development life cycle 

You now understand how products are developed and the role UX designers play in the life cycle. Everywhere you look, you’ll find products of all kinds — big, small, physical, or digital — that have been through this very process. The more you see the intention and thought put into everyday objects, the closer you’ll get to becoming a UX designer!

# Characteristics of good user experience

Good design is easy to spot but often hard to pin down. What exactly makes a product effective to its users? Is it a matter of simplicity, structure, or functionality? The answer depends on the product in question.

In the earlier video, “The basics of user experience design”, you were introduced to some primary characteristics of good UX. These characteristics—**usable**, **equitable**, **enjoyable**, and **useful**—can help you evaluate a product’s design. In this reading, you’ll learn more about each one and why they're important. 

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/-geVNuUUSumHlTblFOrpOQ_7a0ba72f2c634664b0ba7959e5f97ff1_Screenshot-2021-06-21-8.56.56-AM.png?expiry=1727654400000&hmac=wHm9BgZaH5qAgeiaoCAzPVNvMejpHxI6x6GQpsY64Uc)

If a product is **usable**, it means the design, structure, and purpose of the product is clear and easy to use. As you evaluate a product for usability, you can ask questions like: Is everything in the design easy to find? Is the design’s functionality easy to understand? Can users accomplish specific tasks within the design? As you evaluate, these questions can help you determine whether the design delivers a usable experience. 

Imagine you are evaluating the usability of an airline app. Assuming the primary purpose of this app is to book a flight, the design should provide a clear and easy way to complete that task. For example, a section where you can easily enter travel and flight details on the homepage would be an example of good usability.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/GhTYoFVdRwuU2KBVXccLhA_200bcd235c4b40c89a462c200873bff1_Screenshot-2021-06-21-8.58.07-AM.png?expiry=1727654400000&hmac=R51twC_ZUkZSRJpfQ-wthJRCxTvJqeZZ4vnIJE4r758)

If a product is **equitable**, it means a design is helpful to people with diverse abilities and backgrounds. In other words, the product’s design addresses the needs of a diverse audience and ensures a high-quality experience is delivered to all users regardless of background, gender, race, or ability. Equity means providing people with the tools they need to accomplish their goals and support improved quality of life. Equity goes beyond the concept of equality, where everyone is given equal resources, because people often need different tools and support based on their needs. This is especially important to keep in mind for those in commonly disenfranchised groups. As you evaluate the equity of a product’s UX, you can ask questions like: Are the needs of a diverse group of users considered? Does the product’s design address the needs of traditionally underrepresented and excluded groups? These questions can help you determine whether the design delivers an equitable experience. 

Imagine you are evaluating how equitable a social messaging app is. You might consider the design more equitable if the keyboard emoji list includes different skin tones and gender-neutral avatar options.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/X_yuTaK_TcO8rk2iv83Dhw_09116c52367f4ac59f28d2afe84181f1_Screenshot-2021-06-21-8.57.51-AM.png?expiry=1727654400000&hmac=HbbShrZb3SOiutwyvTxU_sbudnnHUo_ayGx472i-mgs)

If a product is **enjoyable**, it means the design delights the user. The design reflects what the user may be thinking or feeling and creates a positive connection with them. A product’s design doesn’t have to be enjoyable for it to function properly. But, an enjoyable design adds to an already functional product and can enhance the user’s feelings about the experience. As you evaluate how enjoyable a product’s UX is, you can ask questions like: Are there aspects of the design that consider the user’s feelings?  Does the design inspire delight in the user? Does the design keep the user engaged throughout their experience? These questions can help you determine whether the design delivers an enjoyable experience. 

Imagine you are evaluating how enjoyable a video streaming app is. Design aspects that might increase how much you enjoy the product include personalized recommendations based on previous watching habits, or the ability to customize the appearance of your account.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/a7t6NgVMRdG7ejYFTLXRCA_51ceae28e7ea4066afdee6322d896df1_Screenshot-2021-06-21-8.57.11-AM.png?expiry=1727654400000&hmac=eNzpX5TpygTvGquSem6q5jacITMl-fptCjRl59DCBRY)

If a product is **useful**, that means it solves user problems. In other words, the design intentionally solves a user problem that the designer has identified. It’s important to note that, while similar, useful and usable have different meanings. A product that is useful isn’t always usable. The same is true for the opposite. The distinction between the two is that usability refers to the product working well and being easy to use, while usefulness refers directly to the ability to solve user problems. As you evaluate how useful a product’s UX is, you can ask questions like: Does the design add value to the user’s experience? Does the design solve a problem for the user? Does the design help the user achieve a specific goal? These questions can help you determine whether the design delivers a useful experience. 

Imagine you’re evaluating how useful a banking app is. Users typically download these apps because they need a place to manage their money. With this in mind, aspects of the app that might be considered useful are features that can be used to transfer money between accounts and pay bills.

# The role of a beginner UX designer

As you start out on your path to becoming a UX designer, you’re probably curious about the actual work your new career might involve. In this reading, you can explore the different responsibilities that entry-level UX designers commonly take on during a project. You'll also review the differences between generalist, specialist, and T-shaped UX designers.

But first, a quick call out: You’ll probably notice a lot of new vocabulary and unfamiliar terms in this reading. Don’t worry! You’ll learn about each of these concepts in more depth throughout the certificate program. We’ll also provide a glossary of important terms and their definitions at the end of each week of content.

## Responsibilities of an entry-level UX designer

As an entry-level UX designer, you’ll have a lot of exciting opportunities to gain experience. When you first start out, you’ll probably take on a lot of different roles and responsibilities. 

![graphic of a person using a laptop, with various icons surrounding them indicating UX design skills](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/SCShS7s9ReSkoUu7PdXkcA_28dbd9eaed4a4cb2a272a61bf0a98c68_Screenshot-2021-03-02-at-11.08.29-PM.png?expiry=1727654400000&hmac=3_jwlVE5eFSdCvE3EnZxE02pUq5Y_MV9rSFw_DhRHIE)

Icons include user research (a tablet with magnifying glass over it) Information architecture (a series of 3 colored, numbered bars) Wireframing (a graphic of a wireframe) Protoyping (a graphic of a desktop monitor with protoype of mobile device on screen) Visual design (a mobile phone next to paint swatches) Effective communication (a graphic of two people talking)

**User research**: User research is about understanding the people who use your product. Through research, you’ll learn about users’ backgrounds, demographics, motivations, pain points, emotions, and goals. Your research methods might include surveys, observations, and interviews. We’ll explore user research in much more detail in an upcoming course. 

**Information architecture:** Information architecture, or IA for short, involves deciding how your product is organized and structured. Think of IA as a skeleton that outlines how users interact with your product. Everything in your product should be organized in ways that make sense to the user and meets their expectations.

**Wireframing**: A wireframe is a basic outline or sketch of a product or a screen, like an app or website. As the name suggests, wireframes look like they were created with wires. They’re mostly lines and shapes, with some text. Wireframes can be drawn by hand or created digitally using software. Wireframing helps you bring your design ideas to life, so other people on your team can provide input and feedback. 

**Prototyping**: A prototype is an early model of a product that demonstrates its functionality. Prototypes can be in physical or digital formats and can vary in complexity. Sometimes a prototype is made to demonstrate one specific feature of a product, like the transition between screens or the way the product physically looks and feels. You’ll make multiple prototypes for any given product throughout the design process.

**Visual design:** Visual design focuses on how the product or technology looks. As a UX designer, you need to understand the foundations of visual design in order to communicate the connection between a product’s functionality and its appearance to users. You’ll learn some of the most important principles of visual design throughout this certificate program. 

**Effective communication**: Effective communication as a UX designer means connecting with your colleagues through emails, meetings, presentations, and design software. UX design is a very collaborative field, so being able to communicate both digitally and face-to-face with teammates is important. You need to be a good listener, be receptive to feedback, and share your ideas in a clear way.

## Specialist and generalist designers

As you get further along in your career, you can choose to specialize in a certain area of UX design or keep your skill set more broad. What exactly are the differences between specialist and generalist UX designers? Read on to learn more!

![Graphic representation of different types of designers.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/qglhcITmR5aJYXCE5qeWeA_b0f22b91196d40198fdba42bf8939541_Screenshot-2021-03-02-at-11.09.03-PM.png?expiry=1727654400000&hmac=HOqdstaX1p0vvQFRBxiA89y1QHnYegHGjBdeLN8_Tl8)

Vertical line - representing a specialist, expert at one thing. Horizontal line - representing a Generalist, broad number of responsibilities T-shaped - expert at one thing and capable in a lot of other things

**Specialist**: A specialist dives deep into one type of UX design, like interaction, visual, or motion design, and becomes an expert. Specialist UX designers are more common at large companies that have a lot of designers, like here at Google. Some of the benefits of becoming a specialist include:

- Focusing on one type of design that you enjoy more than others.
    
- Gaining deep knowledge of one type of design.
    
- Becoming well-known in the industry for your expertise in a particular type of design.
    

**Generalist**: A generalist has a broad number of responsibilities. A majority of UX design jobs are generalist positions, especially at companies with fewer UX designers. Typically, entry-level UX designers work in generalist roles, and some people choose to stay in generalist design roles for their entire careers. There are a lot of benefits to being a generalist UX designer, like: 

- Expanding your skills in many different types of UX work.
    
- Trying a variety of responsibilities and finding an area of UX that you’re especially passionate about. 
    
- Keeping your job feeling fresh and new, while doing a variety of tasks.
    

**T-shaped**: A T-shaped designer is a specialist who also has a lot of capabilities in other areas. T-shaped designers get their name because the stem (or vertical line) of a T represents their expertise in one area, while the top (or horizontal line) symbolizes their related skills in a broad number of areas. T-shaped designers are great to have on your team, since they come with the benefits of both specialists and generalists. The image below highlights some of the skills a T-shaped UX designer might have. In this example, the person is a visual design specialist but also has knowledge in other areas, like coding and prototyping.

![Graphic representation of T shaped designer, who has deep knowledge on visual design.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/213RsksNT-6d0bJLDa_upw_c073c7820c9e488a90b34337addde7d8_Screenshot-2021-03-02-at-11.09.24-PM.png?expiry=1727654400000&hmac=E8OiV6Dw1j7_QP97U0MLBTT8mb_FBzheo6mQl4_WNzg)

Each designer tends to naturally have a little T-shape in their abilities, even at the beginning of their career. As you start to work on projects, you’ll probably notice where your strengths and interests lie. As you get better at one area of design, you’ll likely find yourself working on that part of design projects more often, which helps you continue to improve in one area.

You can also decide to direct your T-shape by developing specific skills that will open up future job opportunities. For example, you might work extra hard on your prototyping skills, in addition to your general UX design skills, which can lead to new experiences and professional growth.

## Your future as a UX designer

There are so many different paths you can take within the field of UX design. After you land your first entry-level job and start working in the field, you’ll get a better idea of whether you want to be a UX design generalist or specialize in one specific type of design. There are plenty of benefits to being a generalist, specialist, or T-shaped designer, so it’s all about finding what works best for you!

# Interact with cross-functional teammates

UX design is a highly collaborative field, where designers typically work in cross-functional teams. Your future teammates might include engineers, UX researchers, program managers, product leads, fellow designers, and others. Working with a diverse group of people across functions helps you learn from their areas of expertise and explore other domains within the field of UX. In this reading, you’ll learn about cross-functional team members you’re likely to work with as a new UX designer. 

## Teams that UX designers work with 

Cross-functional teams come in lots of shapes and sizes, depending on the organization you work for and the project you’re working on. In general, though, there are a handful of key team members that you’ll get to work with as a UX designer.

![Graphic of a person with long hair in a wheelchair, holding a laptop and smiling. Underneath, text says "engineer".](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/vHkZueQ0Rr25GbnkNEa91g_44be8545247e48a588ce1e8b8bdbc227_UX_C1_M1_L2_R2_A.png?expiry=1727654400000&hmac=9uIJzU4jotjqTK_FkYJBjd38MNWWszPgDn7rnIWnzfA)

**Engineers**: Engineers translate designs into a functioning experience, like an app or a website. They help UX teams figure out if designs are feasible from a technical standpoint and bring that idea to life. Working closely with engineers and involving them early in the design process is critical to ensure your project is set up for success.

![Graphic of a person in a hijab, holding a clipboard and a pencil. Underneath, text reads "UX Researcher"](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/1asSIomLSjKrEiKJi_oyRg_80608e849efe4ef2a0129e0d5ec8d89a_UX_C1_M1_L2_R2_B.png?expiry=1727654400000&hmac=eUekMvsRkuWCrO8gMMsoWhdXqrqdzYj2cULA49LbVCo)

**UX researchers**: UX research is all about understanding what users need and expect from your product. UX researchers use methods like observations, interviews, and surveys to understand users' unique perspectives. Findings from research can inform your design decisions each step of the way. If you work at a startup or small business, there’s a good chance you’ll get to do your own UX research. At larger companies though, you’ll likely work with designated UX researchers who will provide research findings to inform your design work. 

![Graphic of a person holding a laptop, with two speech bubbles on the side. Underneath, text reads "Program manager".](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/oQcixZynSMmHIsWcp7jJnA_0e9fad9531bf40e889256cd7d7b07765_Screen-Shot-2021-04-08-at-12.09.39-AM.png?expiry=1727654400000&hmac=arnKZjt7dtNDHhKTaYf7By0RBY8J02ZUBn4g2XwK714)

**Program** **managers****:** Program managers ensure clear and timely communication across the team, so that the process of building a useful product moves smoothly from start to finish. Program managers supervise, support, and keep track of the project as a whole. They assign tasks to team members, monitor the project budget, and manage timelines, among other things. Think of your team’s program manager as your go-to source of support when facing any setbacks or issues with your work.

![Image of a person with short hair,  next to an image of a webpage. Text underneath reads "Product lead"](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/o8ZpFrJPSViGaRayT_lYgA_31bbc9e8d32b4728ba13bf4c761cd415_UX_C1_M1_L2_R2_D.png?expiry=1727654400000&hmac=re1idNRJ9pO3x9sAmtFrX5b9EBLMuWPyN3WAjtN9ehw)

**Product leads:** Product leads are in charge of ensuring the final product’s success and communicating with stakeholders. Your product lead will define the project’s core goals and deliverables, so you can focus on creating innovative design solutions. At some companies, product leads are known as product managers.

![Person with short hair sitting at a desk in front of a computer, text underneath reads "Other UX designers"](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/zPDIgc7EScSwyIHOxHnEVQ_3f346dde1ba549cc927cf95589a3cb1e_UX_C1_M1_L2_R2_E.png?expiry=1727654400000&hmac=q68byzLUs73gSC2Sov7qvonKQEZ-5zTvfODSq6Oo1PQ)

**Other UX designers**: In many cases, you won’t be the sole designer working on a given project, especially if you work at a larger company and when you're a new designer. For example, as an entry-level UX designer, you might collaborate with a more experienced visual designer who can ensure that your designs adhere to the company’s brand standards for things like color and font. Working with other designers is a great chance to learn and ask questions!

## Working together

Creating a strong product requires working with a cross-functional team of brilliant minds, all contributing their unique skills. As a UX designer, you’ll play a vital role that contributes to the team’s success!


# The influence of company size and industry

Have you always dreamed of working with a close-knit group at a startup? Or landing a job at your favorite company? Depending on where you end up working, your job as a UX designer could be quite different! In this reading, you’ll explore how UX design roles can vary depending on the company’s size and industry. 

## Startups and small businesses

**Startups** are new businesses that want to develop a unique product or service and bring it to market. **Small businesses** are privately owned businesses with few employees. A lot of UX designers are excited to start work at startups or small businesses because they can see the impact of their work more quickly and develop a broader range of skills.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/TVGMPLh-QdiRjDy4fkHYwQ_f1f963c8f0e54ecf8453c154d17c25f1_In-House-Graphics-UXD-.png?expiry=1727654400000&hmac=WKYsR2Z6g7r3Hz45BkxXyDSGSwavB9SMThLgoZivRrQ)

- **Team size:** Close-knit team and able to work directly with upper management.
    

- **Growth:** Opportunity for growth due to taking on many responsibilities (visual design, interaction design, user research, and more).
    

- **Creativity:** Usually more creative freedom with fewer guidelines and processes.
    
- **Impact:** Lots of impact on final products, with few people working on a project.

- **Mentorship:** Fewer mentors to choose from within a smaller company.
    

- **Responsibility:** Most of the responsibility for a UX project falls solely on you, which can be stressful if you have little UX experience.
    

- **Speed:** Have to be comfortable working quickly and launching work that isn’t perfect, with little oversight.
    

## Big companies

At a big company, like Google, you’re likely to work in teams on a specific project. Lots of UX designers want to work at big companies with the people who developed some of the most well-known products in the world. UX teams at larger companies tend to be more compartmentalized by specialization, making it easier for you to become an expert in one particular area of UX.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/Pqk6DnnaQrGpOg552kKxgg_75dd90cadd6d494b9ee3922419fcdcf1_In-House-Graphics-UXD-3-.png?expiry=1727654400000&hmac=B0hs5QSBUbJn1kjeqJ-UHlhAntOhWscTzehxCRYi-pg)

- **Team size:** May feel less impactful or important as a contributor with lots of other designers on the project.
    

- **Impact:** May feel small at a company with so many features and products.
    

- **Guidelines:** Defined guidelines can be restrictive to creativity.
    

## Design agencies

A **design agency** is a one-stop-shop for visual brands, products, and services. Working at a design agency can be similar in some ways to working at a small business or startup, except you have multiple companies as your clients. Many agencies tend to work on a broad range of products, so you can explore many kinds of styles and approaches to UX design.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/33crez7ST6e3K3s-0v-nZg_29c104e101a3423d9b2f01ae3c047df1_In-House-Graphics-UXD-4-.png?expiry=1727654400000&hmac=fsw6bPZ_i8xtH70DndGwjIUgEUzrk6YKfLKoa3wx4nY)

- **Mentorship:** Lack of mentorship if you are the only UX designer on a project.
    

- **Monotony:** Depending on the agency, you could work only on the same type of projects.
    

- **Ownership:** Might not be able to work on a project from start to finish.
    

- **Finished product:** Products you work on might not launch, depending on client priorities.
    

## Advertising agencies

A lot of UX designers work at **advertising agencies,** which are teams of creatives hired by clients to build marketing campaigns. Sometimes called “creative technologists,” these designers work to create ads for brands using UX principles. This is a great option if you’re open to learning some interesting skills outside of a core UX design role.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/CyguN1H3T9OoLjdR91_Tvw_6a4da80190884a59ae6772c51a0aadf1_In-House-Graphics-UXD-7-.png?expiry=1727654400000&hmac=qfAp2l2qnePeut8yHW7noDJhzuCILjji3zccEj3YAvA)

- **Variety:** Every project is different based on the client.
    

- **Networking:** Work with a bunch of different brands, clients, and teams.
    

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/ZP9EqmF0QN6_RKphdNDeBg_d3e88521d18d44d88c951ddd7326d6f1_In-House-Graphics-UXD-8-.png?expiry=1727654400000&hmac=vIWP02FQ2tqvS0dXQ2H4Kp4J0k1Ol-QlUlmZEWPc1gI)

- **Specialization:** Wide variation in projects, so you might not be able to hone in on specific skills easily.
    

- **Relevance:** Work may often involve branding and marketing, and might not focus on UX design.
    

## Freelancers

**Freelancers** are self-employed UX designers who are hired by clients for their independent services. Being a freelancer gives you a lot of freedom, and it’s a great way for new UX designers to gain experience in the field and add work to their portfolio. 

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/MSQ2R0UrTKWkNkdFKzylwg_7969f98edcb241e180fca618a461f6f1_In-House-Graphics-UXD-9-.png?expiry=1727654400000&hmac=DU-3DUX75jlywAw_TnVh3jRI-tkVi9z2849MkJ8wy40)

- **Schedule:** Set your own hours since you’re self-employed.
    

- **Flexibility:** Can freelance while working another job or balancing competing priorities.
    

- **Autonomy:** Choose the work that you want to do.
    

- **Experience:** Build your portfolio, especially if you don’t have a full-time UX job.
    

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/u0gJxbz9RouICcW8_YaLeA_aa2f6bf76eb0424084866511e230fff1_In-House-Graphics-UXD-5-.png?expiry=1727654400000&hmac=JRaSZKc7bShzdMAYKAP9w8U-qMEv-1yWkPnlGx7w7Gk)

- **Structure:** No one to report to, which means you have to be responsible for getting work done on time.
    

- **Stability:** Less stable than working for a company or agency, since work is not always guaranteed.
    

- **Business:** Manage the logistics of your own business, such as filing taxes, billing clients, and more.
    

- **Mentorship:** Lack of readily available mentors since you’re working by yourself.
    

## Deciding where to work

Everyone’s goals as a UX designer are different, so think about what’s most important to you when choosing a place to work. Consider questions like:

- Do you enjoy a lot of structure and processes, or do you like to define your own work and schedule? 
    
- Do you value working on a big team, or are you more comfortable working alone? 
    
- Do you want to focus mainly on UX design, or are you interested in broadening your skill set? 
    

Considering your career goals and how you work best will help you start to figure out the kind of company that might be the best fit for you. Good luck!

# Designing cross-platform experiences

When designing a new product or feature, it’s important to think about the different types of platforms that the design will be experienced on. As a refresher, a **platform** is the medium that users experience your product on. Some common platforms are:

- Desktop computers
    
- Laptop computers
    
- Mobile phones
    
- Tablets
    
- Wearables, like smart watches
    
- TVs
    
- Smart displays
    

![Graphic of various portable devices such as laptops, tablets, smart phones, smart watches](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/Mq3e5wUeTFmt3ucFHhxZZg_181dfe02d0cf4baf9cadc7f94d5ddbe9_UX_C1_M2_L4_R1_A.png?expiry=1727913600000&hmac=w99n75OSRF_t3j-LK4KsRojWKwQz_IzVVuaMGtm9Cxg)

A product might be experienced on countless different platforms, but desktop computers, laptop computers, and mobile phones are the most commonly used platforms for interacting with apps and websites. These are the platforms that you'll spend the most time focusing on during this certificate program. In this reading, you'll learn about key considerations when designing for different platforms to help you get started.

## Screen size 

The first consideration when designing for various platforms is adjusting design elements and features to fit different screen sizes. For example, you have a lot of screen space when you design for desktop and laptop computers. But when you design for smaller screens, like mobile phones, you have to carefully decide which parts of the design you'll prioritize including in the limited space. This means making every word, icon, and image count!

In the first five courses of this certificate program, you will design an app for a mobile phone. In the sixth course of the program, you will design a responsive website, which allows the design of a website to change automatically depending on the device's screen size. This means you'll learn a lot more about designing for different screen sizes later in the certificate program, so stay tuned.

## Interaction

In addition to the size of the screen, you also need to consider the way users interact with each platform and how those interactions might affect your design decisions. 

It’s also critical to consider accessibility when developing your designs at each point. Different groups of people will interact with your product in different ways, like using a screen reader, closed captioning, or a switch device. To get started, it’s helpful to try using some of these technologies yourself, in order to understand how people with disabilities might interact with your product on different platforms. 

## Content layout

In the world of UX design, layouts refer to the way that information is organized on the screen. For example, when designing for desktop or laptop computers, you have the advantage of working with a familiar, standardized size: landscape (horizontal) mode. The screen is wide, content can be laid out in columns, and there’s much more flexibility to design. 

In contrast, mobile phone content is usually laid out in portrait (vertical) mode, which is ideal for scrolling. In addition, mobile phones often allow users the option to use landscape (horizontal) mode by rotating their device. Implementing this in your designs requires more work from you as a designer, but provides users with a wider range of options.

Consider the layout of content on a couple more platforms: tablets combine both the desktop and mobile phone user experience, which means you can incorporate aspects of desktop and mobile phone content layouts in your designs. Smartwatches tend to have compact square or rectangular screens, offering very little digital real estate to lay out content. 

## Functionality

There are a lot of reasons why users might choose one platform over another, but functionality and the kind of tasks they want to complete is a huge driver. Your designs for each platform will likely vary based on how and when you expect users to need the product.


# Who are my users?

In the field of user experience design, the “user” comes first. A **user** is a person who is trying to solve a problem and is looking for a product or service to help them solve it. The **user experience** is the journey that the user takes with that product or service. As a UX designer, your goal is to keep the user at the center of every decision you make, and to do that, you need to get to know your user.

Most of the initial UX research that you conduct at the beginning of the project will be focused on getting to know the characteristics of your users, their goals, and their pain points. Understanding the user empowers you to design experiences that are helpful or easy to use. 

One of the key challenges of getting to know your users is avoiding taking a narrow view of the user, or making assumptions about what users need based on stereotypes. Users who seem to be different from one another might actually have shared wants and needs. Make sure to step back and get a clear picture of _all_ your potential users–which often means that you’ll need to specifically plan to address the needs of users who are often overlooked.

To reach as many users as possible, you’ll consider questions such as these as part of your user research approach:

- Do my users have impairments or disabilities to consider–whether temporary, situational, or permanent?
    
- How familiar are my users with technology?
    
- How are my users accessing the product or service?
    
- Where and when are my users accessing the product or service?
    
- Have I considered all my potential users?
    

The goal for user research is to get the widest possible selection of potential users to include as research participants. Make sure to consider income level; demographic data such as age, gender, and ethnicity; educational background; and geographic location. 

## Do my users have impairments or disabilities to consider?

You might be surprised to find out that more than 1 billion people around the world have a disability, out of a global population of 7.8 billion. In the U.S., one in four adults identifies as having a disability. The term **accessibility** refers to the design of products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities. As a UX designer, it’s important to keep users with disabilities in mind as you design features or new products. Designing for accessibility isn't an obstacle, but a way to get your products to as many users as possible.

Accessibility is about making products accessible to all people, whether they have a disability or not. Think about inclusive product features that increase magnification, like enlarged fonts. Or features that help everyone understand videos, like closed captions.

Throughout the rest of the certificate program, you’ll learn more examples of how features that were initially designed for users with disabilities became universally used by non-disabled people as well. You’ll also learn more about how to effectively apply accessibility principles to your designs.

## How familiar are my users with technology?

User experience doesn’t just focus on the experience of existing users, however. It also includes paying attention to the needs of people who are about to become users. Nearly a billion people, of all ages, all around the world, are getting online for the very first time. 

When it comes to designing for this emerging population of potential users, their level of **digital literacy** is a key consideration. The American Library Association defines digital literacy as “the ability to use information and communication technologies to find, evaluate, create, and communicate information, requiring both cognitive and technical skills.” People with limited digital literacy might not be familiar with certain design patterns, calls to action, or icons that those of us with more online experience take for granted. For example, they might not know what “swipe” means in relation to a touchscreen. They may not even know what a touchscreen is. This can affect their confidence and willingness to explore new technology.

## How are my users accessing the product or service?

It’s important to keep in mind that not all users will access your product or service in the same way due to the cost and availability of devices and internet services. These factors are often due to other broader and historical factors in the markets you might be designing for.

Some users might not have reliable or unlimited access to the internet. This might be because the data they have purchased has run out or because their network coverage is inconsistent or sporadic. As a UX designer, you should try to find ways to take the offline experience into account as well. For more examples of ways you can create a rich offline experience for your users, check out the article [_Offline UX design guidelines_](https://web.dev/offline-ux-design-guidelines/) on web.dev.

## Where are my users accessing the product or service?

In some cases, you might be designing a product or service intended for use by people in various locations around the world, which creates some additional considerations, like local languages and cultural norms. Keep in mind that cultures and norms are ever-changing as people integrate and recontextualize technology in their lives, so you’ll need to continue to research potential users to identify shifts in user problems, preferences, and usage patterns over time.

Users who speak languages other than the primary language of the product or service you’re designing might want or need to switch languages on their device depending on what they’re trying to accomplish. For example, a user might want to read in Hindi but type using the English keyboard. Or the user might encounter a concept that cannot be easily translated from one language to another. Designing a multilingual keyboard option, and using universally-recognized icons, like an icon with a local currency sign for a banking app, are just a few key ways UX designers can make it easier for users in different locales.

## Key takeaway

Your goal as a UX designer is to solve a user problem by creating a design that makes every user feel like you designed the experience just for them no matter who they are, where they live, how much they earn, what their abilities are, or how highly they're educated. Gaining a comprehensive understanding of your user's context is an important place to start, and you're already on your way.

Throughout the rest of the certificate program, you’ll learn more about the considerations discussed in this reading, dig deeper into user research methodology, and complete some practice activities to learn more about your users.

# User-centered design and assistive technology

As you’ve been learning, user-centered design means trying to solve problems that people commonly experience rather than trying to solve only those problems that you experience personally. You’ve also been learning that good user-centered design incorporates the assistive technology, or AT, that many people use to interact with their devices. AT works in things such as color modification, voice control, switch devices, and screen readers. 

While assistive technologies are often created to support people with disabilities, they’re also used by many people who don’t have disabilities or who don’t identify as having disabilities. For example, consider the technology that allows someone to pinch a smartphone screen to expand an image or piece of text. That technology is used both by people who have visual impairments and by people who don’t.

But when exactly do UX designers incorporate assistive technologies into their designs? The answer is straightforward: Effective UX designers consider assistive technology throughout the design process, from understanding users’ experiences, to identifying users’ needs, to designing and testing solutions. 

Check out the following examples.

## **Color modification** 

First, consider assistive technologies for color modification. A UX designer is creating a job-application form that users can access and complete on their mobile devices. During the early phases of the design process, the designer tries to understand how users might experience the form on a variety of devices. The designer discovers that some users use both light-mode settings and dark-mode settings to comfortably see and use their devices, switching back and forth depending on their surroundings and the application they’re using.

Based on this information, the designer plans to include a “light mode/dark mode” toggle in the application form itself so users can easily select how they want to view the application form. This feature minimizes the risk that certain users will miss key instructions or interactive features, like text-input fields and buttons.

## **Switch devices**

Now consider an example where a team has to redesign a product after forgetting to account for switch devices. (Remember that a switch device is a technology that replaces a keyboard or a mouse. Switch devices enable people to interact with devices without using one or both of those pieces of hardware.)

A UX design team is working on a new website for a local restaurant. The team finishes its first prototype, which allows test users to simulate navigating the live website. One user reports that they can’t use their mouse to navigate the prototype. Keyboard navigation is an answer to that problem: It’s a common switch technology that enables users to navigate websites and apps strictly with their keyboards, so they don’t have to scroll and click with a mouse.

The principles of user-centered design demand that websites support keyboard navigation. And in many places, laws and regulations require the same! This means the design team must return to an earlier phase of its design process and re-work its prototype to support that switch device. The team could have avoided this re-work if it had used the early phases of its process to better understand how its users use switch devices.

## **Voice control**

Now consider voice control technologies, which enable people to interact with products by using their voices rather than mouses, keyboards, or touch screens. For example, a UX designer is creating a vocal user interface, or VUI, for a smart thermostat. The VUI will enable users to interact with the thermostat by speaking. 

At the very beginning of their process, the designer researches how users interact with similar voice control technologies: The designer observes people interacting with other smart thermostats to get a sense for how different users express the same commands. With this information, the designer creates a VUI that enables people to use multiple questions or commands to achieve the same tasks, like lowering the temperature or turning the thermostat off and on.

## **Screen readers**

Finally, consider user-centered design and screen readers. Screen readers read the text on a screen. They also read alternative text, or alt text. Alt text is text that describes non-textual elements of a screen, such as images and graphics. Screen readers read alt text aloud so users can understand the screen’s non-textual elements and how they fit with the screen’s textual content. 

When designing with screen readers in mind, it’s crucial to consider your users, determine which images they’ll find meaningful (rather than merely decorative), and then create clear alt text to describe those visuals. With clear alt text in place, users can get value out of your product’s images even if they have visual impairments or low-bandwidth connections that make it difficult for images to load.

## **Grow through daily observations**

If you haven’t already, start observing how you use assistive technologies to interact with everyday products. Do you ever turn on closed captions while streaming a movie? Ask a smart speaker to play your favorite song? Or use the tab key to move from one text-input field to another? If so, you’ve used assistive technology. The next time, stop to consider how the designer incorporated that technology into their design process. Over time, these small observations can help you grow into the user-centered designer you want to be!# Glossary terms from module 2

# Design thinking: A UX design framework

In the world of UX design, a **framework** is a conceptual tool that provides guidance on the best practices and processes for solving  problems and building solutions that solve the problems of real users. Frameworks provide structure for the design process and foster collaboration, which can spark innovations. Most UX designers follow a specific framework or process when approaching their work, from the first idea all the way through to the final launch of a product.

In this certificate program, you’ll follow the **design thinking** framework to sequence the assignments that contribute to the designs that you’ll create throughout the program. The design thinking framework is a user-centered approach to problem-solving that includes activities like research, prototyping, and testing to help you understand who your user is, what their problems are, and what your design should include.

The design thinking framework involves the following phases: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test.

![Process flow that represents the design thinking process: 1. Empathize, 2. Define, 3. Ideate, 4. Prototype, and 5. Test.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/GG-UjxAJTjqvlI8QCc46CA_56b42a56f7534b9d80437b91462f53d8_UX_C1_M2_L2_R1_C-01.png?expiry=1727913600000&hmac=dPymCXAEY7bR3YFSmXkTluo_k6YvGdDnqvsVNwBc-Vg)

Though it may sound like a linear process, the design thinking framework should be iterative, which means that you’ll repeat certain phases as you refine your designs. For example, depending on the feedback you receive during testing, you might need to conduct additional research, brainstorm new ideas, or develop new prototypes. 

Let’s look at the five phases of the design thinking framework to learn more about which activities you’ll perform during each one. Keep in mind that the design thinking framework as presented here is an idealized model for UX designers to follow, so you might see some variation in its implementation between different companies, teams, or projects.

## Empathize

During the **empathize** phase, your primary goal is to learn more about the user and their problems, wants, and needs, and the environment or context in which they’ll experience your design. The most important part of the empathize phase is to step away from your assumptions and guesses and let your research findings inform your decision-making in later design phases.

Your user research might include user surveys, interviews, and observation sessions, and you might also need to conduct some research on the competitors’ products to determine how your user frames competitors’ products as part of their daily life and daily problem-solving.

## Define

In the **define** phase, you’ll analyze your research findings from the empathize phase and determine which user problems are the most important ones to solve, and why. This will drive you toward a clear goal for the design of the product.

The most important outcome of this phase is a clear problem statement, which is a description of the user’s need that your designs will address. You might also develop a value proposition, which is a summary of why your user would or should use the product or service that you’re designing.

## Ideate

After you land on a user problem and establish why it’s an important one to solve, it’s time for the **ideate** phase. The goal of ideation is to come up with as many design solutions as possible—don’t settle for your first solution because the most obvious solution is not always the right one.

Ideation involves collaborative brainstorming with other members of your team to generate as many solutions as possible to a problem. This could include marketing, engineering, product management, or any other stakeholders for the product or service. During brainstorming sessions, you should explore all possible solutions. Don’t focus on whether something is a “good” or “bad” idea, just collect as many ideas as you can. The important thing here is to keep this process judgment-free.

After brainstorming, you’ll then analyze your potential solutions and start to make choices about which ones are the best options to pursue as prototypes. You might return to user or competitive research to help you narrow down your ideas, and you might also create user flows to illustrate how the user will interact with your solution.

## Prototype and Test

After you have an idea of how to solve the problem, you’re ready to enter the **prototype** phase, where your goal is to produce an early model of a product that demonstrates its functionality and can be used for testing. The **test** phase is critical to developing the right solution to address your user’s problem, and an organized approach to testing can help you create exceptional user experiences.

Prototyping and testing are interconnected, which means that you’ll test your designs at each stage of prototype development rather than waiting to test until after the working prototype is complete. If the design is too polished the first time you present it to users, you might not get as much feedback. Think about ways to include testing throughout the design process, so that you’re iterating your designs based on user feedback instead of other reasons. 

For example, you might test the concepts behind your design by presenting users with a simple sketch, wireframe, or a sitemap. Taking what you learned, you might iterate on that design to a more detailed design on paper (known as a low-fidelity prototype) and conduct another round of user testing. At some point, you’ll iterate the design again into a working, interactive model using a software program (also known as a high-fidelity prototype) and test that as well. You might also consider testing more than one prototype at the same time to get feedback on multiple solutions, or testing the same prototype on multiple platforms, such as a laptop, tablet, and smartphone. 

The goal of testing prototypes is to continue to refine the prototype as you gain insight into whether the design for your product or service is easy to use and solves the user’s problem. At some point, you’ll finalize a prototype, and then you’ll provide it to developers, who will then turn your design into a product.

## Key takeaways

The design thinking framework is only one type of framework that UX designers use to organize their approach to designs, often based on the product they’re designing and the organization they’re working for. No matter which frameworks you use in your career, they all have a few core principles in common:

- Focus on the user.
    
- Create solutions that address the user’s problems.
    
- Collaborate with teammates across departments.
    
- Validate your designs.
    
- Iterate as needed to design the right user experience.
    

Throughout the rest of the certificate program, you’ll learn more about each of the phases of the design thinking framework and complete practice activities to gain more experience with designing user experiences end-to-end.

# UX design business requirements

You’ve learned that design thinking is a user-centered and multi-stage approach to solving problems. Its goal is to create products that effectively address real user needs. And it has five phases: empathizing with users, defining their needs, ideating solutions, prototyping solutions, and testing those solutions.

![Process flow that represents the Design Thinking framework: 1. Empathize, 2. Define, 3. Ideate, 4. Prototype, and 5. Test.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/YQ3Vp8suTFijOJUWxQ5_hA_5fe1723511684513a6a21ce7406257f1_9IbeIgRnk2_oIAC1pLPC2VqWmgJlCqCmbiMcxzz624iljXDi86q18Lc4hBXQr1nFUVf0OOJYi2RM05m_pZ6QAlCWqEAdHEBqvNMp4RDFl6PegDm-ccV2brLjc-jUpyKTMR_GgTZa6CkVYHjxkUCbXRo?expiry=1727913600000&hmac=cedtHbdagvQuBsGN4ajjiDAGjh989bAC5X5cxH8wLiA)

You’ve also learned that while this process looks neat and linear, the reality is often more cyclical. The best UX designers iterate throughout the process, moving back and forth between stages to do things like redefine user needs or develop alternative prototypes.

In fact, in many real-world situations, design thinking doesn’t even start with empathizing. Instead, it starts when a designer gets an assignment for a new project. Good UX designers take time to carefully understand these assignments before they move forward. Why? Because most assignments include crucial business requirements that must be considered at every stage of the design thinking process. 

## **Business requirements**  

For any UX design project, business requirements come from whatever entity assigns the project. That entity might be a for-profit business, a nonprofit organization, a governmental organization, or something else. But no matter where they come from, business requirements typically include two kinds of information: goals and parameters.

Business goals typically describe:

- The users they want the design to target
    
- The outcomes they want the design to achieve
    
- Their vision for the design’s final look and functionality
    

Business parameters typically describe:

- The project’s budget, timeline, and scope
    
- The specific tools and systems that designers must use or design for
    
- The requirements and standards the design must meet
    

Business requirements vary depending on the project and its key players, and they can often be negotiated over the project’s lifecycle. And just as these requirements may evolve over the course of the project, so too should they shape designers’ execution of the design thinking process in powerful ways. In the empathize phase, for example, UX designers connect with users and gather information about their needs. This task costs time and money, so it should be conducted in ways that fit the project’s schedule and budget. 

Here’s an example of a UX designer encountering business requirements for a new project. As you learn about design thinking in upcoming readings, you’ll explore examples of how this UX designer creates an effective product while meeting business requirements.

A bakery owner is contracting a freelance UX designer to design a new website. The bakery serves customers exclusively through delivery and pick-up orders. Since its founding two years ago, the bakery has advertised and taken orders over the phone and through its social media accounts. This approach has helped the bakery connect directly with customers and build a loyal base without partnering with third-party ordering services.

But as sales have increased, the owner and their team have struggled to individually process orders as they come in through multiple channels. They need a website that will help them maintain a direct connection with customers while enabling them to process orders in a more automated and efficient way.

When they contract with their freelance UX designer, the bakery owner shares their goals and parameters. With a modest budget and relatively short time-frame, they want a simple website that supports online ordering without routing users to third-party ordering services. The site must be easy to navigate, maintain, and update. It must also reflect the bakery’s existing brand and appeal to its target customers. While the bakery’s customers come from a range of locations and demographics, the majority are 35–70 years old and they live or work in the local area.

These business requirements provide an invaluable starting point for the designer, who reviews them to learn more about their end users, understand their budget and timeframe, and start planning the rest of their design thinking process.

## **Key takeaways**

Though design thinking technically starts with empathizing, actual design projects typically start with business requirements. Business requirements are goals and parameters set by whatever business or other entity is assigning the design project. They state crucial details like the business’s budget, timeframe, and vision for the design. Effective UX designers understand these requirements and consider them at every stage of the Design Thinking process. You’ll learn more about the first phase of design thinking—and how it’s shaped by business requirements—in the next reading.


# Phase 1: Empathize with users

You’ve learned that good UX designers consider business requirements at every stage of the design thinking process. These requirements are set by whatever business or entity assigns the design project. They include crucial details like a business’s schedule, budget, and vision for the product that’s being designed.

![Process flow of design thinking framework: 1. Empathize, 2. Define, 3. Ideate, 4. Prototype, and 5.

Process flow of design thinking framework: 1. Empathize, 2. Define, 3. Ideate, 4. Prototype, and 5. Test. Empathize is highlighted.

After understanding these requirements, designers are ready to start the first phase of the design thinking process: **empathize**. 

When you empathize with people, you try to deeply understand their feelings, thoughts, and experiences on their own terms, without bias or preconceptions. Empathizing helps designers connect with users, not just as consumers or customers, but as human beings with their own unique histories and situations. This kind of deep connection helps designers create products that solve real problems, address real needs, and engage users in the long term. 

## **Building on business requirements**

When empathizing, designers seek to understand how users experience the product they’re designing. They want to know their users’ problems and needs, and they want a clear understanding of the situations and environments where users interact with the product. The more a designer understands these details, the better equipped they are to create products that truly meet users’ needs in the long term.

Some of this user information will likely be included in the project’s business requirements, but it may be limited or based on assumptions. That’s why good UX designers use the empathize phase to validate, update, and expand on the user information in their project’s business requirements. They do this by connecting directly with users and researching their experiences. 

Here are some powerful methods for empathizing with users as a UX designer:

## **Interviews**

Interviews take many forms, but UX designers most commonly use four: 

1. Questionnaires/surveys
    
2. In-person interviews
    
3. Phone interviews
    
4. Video interviews
    

Before starting interviews, designers consider the type and amount of information they need. Next, good designers consider their business requirements: how much time, money, and other resources do they have for planning and conducting interviews? Finally, designers can plan interviews that achieve the best balance between their information needs and their project’s parameters. 

## **Empathy maps**

Once designers have conducted their interviews, they can turn to empathy maps. These are a great tool for processing the information a designer has collected. In a classic empathy map, designers draw directly from interviews to answer five questions about their users:

1. Who exactly **are** the users and what are their situations?
    
2. What do users **say** about their experiences with the product or similar products?
    
3. What do users **think** about their experiences?
    
4. What do users **do** before, during, and after their experiences?
    
5. What do users **feel** about their experiences?
    

Ideally, the answers to these questions will build on any user information included in a project’s business requirements. 

For example, in the business requirements you explored in the previous reading, the bakery owner claims their older customers prefer ordering over the phone because they aren’t comfortable with online order forms. But the UX designer’s empathy research tells a different story: Many older customers are comfortable with online ordering but prefer phone ordering because they think it’s faster and feel an emotional connection with the bakery and its staff. In this way, the designer’s empathy research has updated and expanded the user information in the bakery’s business requirements. 

## **User personas**

Personas are fictional characters who represent groups of similar users. They help designers distill large amounts of user information into more manageable chunks. 

For example, the older bakery customers  prefer ordering over the phone for a mix of reasons. But rather than try to remember these details in the abstract, the designer creates a user persona who brings this customer to life: 

Berta is an older customer who has built connections with bakery staff over time and enjoys connecting with them while ordering over the phone. Also, she has a visual impairment and finds phone ordering faster and more convenient than ordering online.

Once designers have established personas, they can keep their users in mind throughout the design thinking process without having to remember every detail they captured during their interviews. These personas also help designers explain their design choices to clients and other business stakeholders. Rather than try to describe their users in the abstract, they use user personas to tell compelling stories that put their designs in context.

## **Key takeaways**

In the empathize phase of design thinking, designers seek to understand their users through a variety of research methods, including interviews, empathy maps, and user personas.

The goal of empathizing is to understand  users' problems, wants, needs, and situations in order to design a product that works for them and creates an enjoyable experience. Throughout this phase, good UX designers try to understand users as deeply as they can while still working within key business requirements, like timeline and budget.


# Phase 2: Define users’ needs

You’ve learned that effective UX designers typically start the design thinking process only after they’ve understood their project’s goals, parameters, and other business requirements. You’ve also learned about the first phase of the design thinking process: empathize. Empathizing is all about connecting with users, gathering information about them, and distilling that information into detailed user personas. 

![Process flow that represents the Design Thinking framework: 1. Empathize, 2. Define, 3. Ideate, 4. Prototype, and 5. Test](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/S_YQHw1-SI-3wwly8Sd7dg_e16339c22e4343f9b03a80cdf5aec8f1_r7iDmTAEI3HJPZeBhY61Ub8ms-wePYYxdC6bZ-7QHMdatyYWTDhPpoIhBbiZH-pssXLJ3CVoCR20fIQcjMDDJn25ko_0n-wfxDEkEm1Xa0rIuR494INUnLgIdom6bG5694P29satnGvA9OwxQFNjl10?expiry=1727913600000&hmac=CmHD4bDMROiXO95BWfcV5I8Ny2DM7_iD8LqyO1uBg6c)

Process flow that represents the Design Thinking framework: 1. Empathize, 2. Define, 3. Ideate, 4. Prototype, and 5. Test. Define is highlighted.

After empathizing, designers move to the next phase of design thinking: **define**. In the define phase, designers analyze their empathy work to answer this key question: Which of my users’ needs or problems are the most important ones for my design to address? Typically, designers use a combination of tools to answer this question. 

## **User stories**

While a user persona distills a large group of similar users into a single character, user stories help designers focus their understanding of those users even more. A user story is a one-sentence narrative told from a persona’s perspective. It should encapsulate **who** the user is, **what** they want to do, and **why** they want to do it. The following is a simple template for writing a user story: 

As **[type of user]**, I want to **[action]** so that **[benefit]**.

When done well, a user story gives the designer information they can use to create a checklist they can return to as they define their users’ needs and ideate effective solutions. For example, recall Berta, one of the user personas in the bakery example you’ve been exploring. For Berta, the UX designer might develop a user story like this:

As a long-time customer with a visual impairment and a close connection to the bakery staff, I want to place my orders over the phone so I can order with ease and continue to connect with staff members.

## **User journeys** 

Once a designer has distilled their user groups into realistic personas and stories, it’s time to start mapping out each persona’s user journey. A user journey is a series of experiences that the user has as they try to achieve their goal. It might be an experience they have with the product that’s being designed, an experience they have with a similar product, or an experience they have in the absence of those products. 

In developing the new bakery website, for example, the UX designer creates two user journeys for each persona, including Berta. One of Berta’s user journeys reflects how users like her typically interact with the bakery and its current ordering systems (a mixture of phone ordering and direct messages on social media accounts). The other user journey reflects how users like Berta will typically interact with website-based ordering systems, which is the type of product the designer is creating.

## **Problem statements**

With complete user journeys for each persona, a designer can better identify the problems their design must solve or the needs their design must address. Then, they can distill these problems or needs into problem statements. 

A problem statement summarizes **who** the user is, **what** they need from a design, and **why**. The following is a simple template for writing a problem statement:

**[Name of user persona]** is a **[type of user]** who needs **[type of user experience]** because **[benefits of user experience]**.

This template is similar to a user story, but problem statements are typically more detailed, and they are written from the designer’s perspective. For example, here’s a problem statement for Berta:

Berta is an older person with a visual impairment. She is a long-time bakery customer who prefers ordering over the phone. She needs a website and online ordering system that are easy to use, adapt to her vision needs, and mimic the feel and flow of a friendly phone conversation. She wants to place her orders with ease and feel like she’s making a personal connection with the bakery.

Effective UX designers create problem statements for each of their user personas. This helps designers create products that address the needs of multiple user types rather than catering solely to one type of user. 

## **Key takeaways**

In the define phase of design thinking, designers build on their business requirements and empathy work to state a series of specific problems they want their design to address. These problems should emerge from a thorough understanding of who users are and how they experience the product, including the specific tasks they encounter and the feelings they bring to those tasks, such as placing orders at a bakery.

# Phase 3: Ideate solutions

In the second phase of design thinking, designers build on their empathy research to **define** and select the user problems they need to address. In the third phase, they **ideate** possible solutions to those problems. 

![Process flow that represents the design thinking framework: 1. Empathize, 2. Define, 3. Ideate, 4. Prototype, and 5. Test](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/0Qc0M_DdTiSCQjbeGr0ASg_bdf253c73ee04a4fa3edd3ec278697f1_AaBIQjBJukJQF5G7O9UQRvPvwIfKfpmAmLYchvh1RnM6pQ5APhymzjRL7BvVzLTTKq0V7DkHX403Xdt_B0-w0qLtW-hO3MK40rfNydBCMfkAoUNP05tdGjW6eNFS9_Td45LU6WL5f2RWBKVog8iZHcw?expiry=1727913600000&hmac=UjLXVjNDhSoVyLRCmMUrKRtV8c8ln3m3tFS4sqUWTfA)

Process flow that represents the design thinking framework: 1. Empathize, 2. Define, 3. Ideate, 4. Prototype, and 5. Test. Ideate is highlighted.

The ideate phase is all about getting creative and brainstorming lots of potential solutions. Designers often collaborate with team members, business stakeholders, and potential users. Their ideas may be unexpected or out of the box, and that’s great! 

Early in the ideate phase, good designers try to suspend their assumptions, preconceptions, and judgements: The goal is to propose, consider, and challenge as many alternatives as possible without evaluating or selecting any one. Evaluation and selection come in later in the ideate phase: Once plenty of ideas are on the table, designers have a better chance to compare alternatives and select the best.

As you’ll learn in a later course, there are many, many different techniques for brainstorming, and the best UX designers choose, adapt, and create new techniques as needed. For now,  here are some of the most common:

## **“How might we?”**

In this brainstorming exercise, designers take a problem statement from the define phase and turn it into a list of questions that start with “How might we,” or HMW.  HMW questions help designers reframe user problems as exciting opportunities for solutions. For example, recall the problem statement you explored in the previous reading defining user needs:

Berta is an older person with a visual impairment. She is a long-time bakery customer who prefers ordering over the phone. She needs a website and online ordering system that are easy to use, adapt to her vision needs, and mimic the feel and flow of a friendly phone conversation. She wants to place her orders with ease and feel like she’s making a personal connection with the bakery as she places her orders.

If the bakery’s UX designer reframed this problem statement as a series of HMW questions, they might include:

- How might we make the online ordering process easy to use?
    
- How might we make the online ordering system mimic a friendly conversation?
    
- How might we ensure the online ordering system adapts to Berta’s vision needs?
    

After creating these HMW questions, good UX designers spend time answering them with as many possible solutions as they can think of—and they don’t hold back!

## **Rapid Sketching**

While “How might we?” focuses on written questions and solutions, Rapid Sketching is a visual approach to ideation. (It’s commonly called “Crazy Eights” in the UX design industry.) Rapid Sketching is especially useful when designers need to brainstorm the visual elements of a new design. First, designers clarify the problem they’re trying to solve or the idea they’re trying to iterate. They might use one of the questions or solutions they developed in a HMW exercise. Then, they:

1. Divide a large sheet of paper into eight squares.
    
2. Grab something to draw with.
    
3. Start an eight-minute timer.
    
4. Take one minute to sketch an idea or solution in each square.
    

When the eight-minute timer goes off, there should be a different sketch in each of the paper’s eight squares. Designers can adapt this approach as needed. For example, if a designer has less time or smaller sheets of paper, they might start with four squares and four minutes for sketching.

## **Competitive audits**

When designers want new ideas about how to solve a problem, they can also audit their competitors by asking questions, like: 

- What products do they offer? 
    
- What are those products’ strengths and areas for improvement? 
    

By answering questions like these, designers can get inspiration for their own designs, identify gaps in the market, and find evidence for what designs have already worked and not worked.  With audits, designers can save time, money, and effort by learning from competitors who have already designed similar products or tried to solve similar problems.

## **SCAMPER**

SCAMPER is a technique designers used to brainstorm changes and alternatives to ideas and designs. Each letter of the acronym stands for a different action that designers can apply to their designs, such as substituting (S) elements for other elements, combining (C) elements into one, or adapting (A) elements with alternatives. In full, the acronym stands for: Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, and Rearrange. 

## **Collaboration**

Ideation typically works best when it’s collaborative. Effective design teams often ideate together in collaborative working sessions. And whether they’re working alone or in a team, designers often bring other players into the ideation process, including their users and their business stakeholders. 

Before launching a collaborative partnership or working session, effective designers or design teams typically ensure they’ve answered crucial questions such as:

- Who will be involved? What will their roles be?
    
- Where will the collaboration happen? Will it be in person or virtual?
    
- Why is the collaboration happening? What is the end goal?
    
- How will the collaboration happen? What tools and processes will we use?
    

## **Business requirements**

Ideation techniques help designers brainstorm lots of ideas, but will those ideas meet their project’s business requirements? As designers review their ideas, they must refer to their business requirements and ask questions like these:

- Which of these ideas will be feasible within the project’s budget and schedule?
    
- Which of these ideas will best meet the standards for the design?
    

While ideation starts with exploring boundless possibilities, there will always be firm parameters for a project. Good UX designers often try to frame these parameters positively: They are obstacles that inspire creative problem solving, guardrails that keep the design process on track, and filters for sifting through all those boundless possibilities. 

## **Key takeaways**

In the ideate phase of design thinking, UX designers brainstorm lots of possible solutions to the user problems they’ve identified. They use brainstorming and research techniques like “How might we?” (HMW), Rapid Sketching, competitive audits, and SCAMPER. It should be a fun, creative, and judgment-free process: The more ideas, the better! But once the ideas are out there, good UX designers take time to check possible solutions against their project’s business requirements. Ultimately, their goal is to choose the solution that will satisfy requirements while also working best for users.

# Phase 4: Prototype solutions

When a designer has empathized with their users, defined their users’ needs, and ideated solutions, it’s time to start the fourth phase of design thinking: **prototyping solutions.**

![Process flow that represents the Design Thinking framework: 1. Empathize, 2. Define, 3. Ideate, 4. Prototype, and 5. Test](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/r9c7NJx9S3OrV4O7xbUBVA_15caed65cd3b47f39d204517a08cc6f1_AgpcuzxTnl6olsC_rvBrtl6QtsUKY3VNe-lxDqxBKW1oRhhecVK_1hGORaIbrC3_Dl9yi5j1JWjDOaPMp7eMNzhaOM05zbFWk33PbOAtfR4mUzF0M_pQAl8a0h-JnZbEDshb9lsrWtUTN6H8bK17JY8?expiry=1727913600000&hmac=VA6GnrLo3q27VM-jEHCWkzXl34JcufljlLjdeKx6mGI)

Process flow that represents the Design Thinking framework: 1. Empathize, 2. Define, 3. Ideate, 4. Prototype, and 5. Test. Prototype is highlighted.

In the prototyping phase, the goal is not to build a final product. Rather, designers produce early models, or prototypes, of the solution so they can see how it will look and function for users. Prototypes also show stakeholders and potential users what the design can do. So, how do designers prototype? There are many practices they can use.  

## **Information architecture and sitemaps**

To meet users’ needs, products like web apps must present information in ways that users can understand and navigate with ease and enjoyment. When designers organize the information in a product, they create something called “information architecture,” or IA. Information architecture is essentially a high-level diagram or flowchart that shows how users can move through a product, like a website or an app.

In planning a product’s information architecture, designers often create something called a sitemap, like this one for a website:

![Sitemap showing main categories. Under each category shows six subcategories reading left to right:](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/Vr4ZWI44THiKSFkuDU1pmw_d16d76758f2647c1bdf06f04ae974cf1_OpcC9IPta-FpQNYdt8Mi-ye-ao8dDzbEk3aHoU9dwQcZVYDMuKvqR37yCjpYeYSU8fWUVhcZD-FHlvTpOM5MOCn6SX2NKYhQLHqKvRkofwgQVns-cQmeVcUlLFjTmgvoIbbQ-ii58slNoZNCtl-mQ0w?expiry=1727913600000&hmac=zLDDKc2fDhAQT4QVU4FtZ8GPHoDa5saj8-uIHC_8uGk)

Shop with seven subcategories below; Lookbooks with four subcategories; Search filters includes price, color, size, material, online-only, popularity and sale; Log In/Sign up includes forgot password and create account; Cart with five subcategories; and Footer/Other which includes general information about the business and help.

Like all good information architecture, this sitemap organizes the product by outlining its hierarchy and sequence:

- Hierarchy refers to how topics are prioritized and subordinated. Hierarchies emphasize topics that are broader or more important, which in turn contain smaller or less important topics. In the sitemap above, for example, “Shop” is a major topic that contains smaller topics, like “Denim/Pants.”
    
- Sequence refers to the order in which users can navigate through the product’s hierarchy, like navigating from the “Homepage” to “Shop” to “Denim/Pants” and so on.
    

Information architecture and sitemaps are crucial for meeting users’ needs. For example, recall the designer who is developing a website and online ordering system for a bakery. One of the designer’s user personas is an older customer who prefers phone ordering because they enjoy talking with bakery staff. 

So, the designer aims to create a website and ordering system that replicate the experience of ordering over the phone. The design’s success will depend in large part on its information architecture. In creating the website’s sitemap, for instance, the designer uses hierarchy and then sequences information so that users enter the homepage and immediately see an option to “Place an Order,” just as they might be invited to place an order after being greeted by bakery staff over the phone.

## **Wireframing**

Wireframes are rough sketches of the product that bring the sitemap to life. Designers use them to figure out how the product’s pages are laid out, how each page’s elements are arranged, and how users will progress from page to page. They are relatively bare bones, consisting primarily of shapes, lines, and minimal text. There are two methods designers can employ:

## **Paper wireframes**

Paper wireframes are sketches on paper. They use horizontal lines to represent text, rectangles or boxes to represent icons or images, and other shapes to represent buttons and additional elements. It’s easy and inexpensive to iterate many versions with paper. 

![Example of paper wireframes showing eight screens that are drawn with pencil and paper.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/OHKeW_jbSkyIjYX1yRDPbw_cf8743c8713d4ab9b1f2874e1ecc4af1_90ghDYN9KmUaD_r7gGY-QUE6JxWgSk2w_Dfk_S4eoS4O81P0t77T_BiKAgBz2vNPuUm8vTQbnMxS3yOH-h76KgVhUwsEbD9AH49dC9iES4SHkQNJauB6erjpaHU5wO7lc1BJ9S1VVMFGIbFkF9dE7TE?expiry=1727913600000&hmac=bO_TaMEKTKvxoJO7YJfSHEzayK1G69ZGci_xFrO8j3I)

## **Digital wireframes**

Digital wireframes are developed in a UX design tool such as Figma or Adobe XD. Digital wireframes are 2D designs that show, at a high level, what the product will look like. Designers use grayscale, shapes, and placeholder text to demonstrate what the design will look and feel like when content is added. (On a fun side-note: **Lorem ipsum** is a form of placeholder text that is so common that many designers like to play around with it for fun, to inspire creativity. Check out [Meet the Ipsums](https://meettheipsums.com/) to explore.)

## **Low fidelity (lo-fi) prototypes**

In UX, “fidelity” means how closely a design matches the look and feel of the final product. A low fidelity prototype is a simple interactive model that provides a basic idea of what the product will look like and how its components will flow for users. Designers often create lo-fi prototypes by assembling their wireframes and adding interactivity, or the ability to navigate from one screen to another. Designers use lo-fi prototypes to test and improve their designs before spending time and effort developing more detailed high-fidelity prototypes. 

## **High fidelity (hi-fi) prototypes**

A high fidelity prototype takes the lo-fi prototype and brings it as close to the final product as possible. Hi-fi prototypes incorporate all of the product’s components, interactivity, and content, though some content may be represented by realistic placeholders. It is not the final product, but it enables people to more fully experience how the product will look, feel, and work. For example, consider the richly detailed hi-fi prototype for Tee’s Shirts below. More than just an assembly of navigable wireframes, this hi-fi prototype will enable testers and stakeholders to simulate a realistic experience with the final product, which means richer and more detailed feedback for designers on every facet of the final product.

![Hi-fi prototype example for Tee’s Shirts website.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/TclqzHRPQgKfJi_YAqaBcQ_73f31f19bce24014b9cc001320b147f1_VQQd61OfSUoo9f06PyflGu0CMmpgcl_fV_Q-iLeVZTDI451gDmofuX7nQPRe-TBluipxPnQydXXKTKn5Olb9VsDFddgrMgznGXLyikTUuMlX0W-q5oiJBl0rjgbmmDJAOeNiXojMW5nMKq-tsN879Gw?expiry=1727913600000&hmac=3yY7m1BEXDzTYGlffwHPTQyFVmw6J5ruOflJKAaKp8Q)

During prototyping, whether lo-fi or hi-fi, designers often revisit information and decisions from earlier stages of the design thinking process. When evaluating prototypes, for example, they should ask if the layout, flow, look, and feel address the problem statement developed during the define phase. Would Berta, the bakery customer persona you met earlier, be able to easily use the site to order? Does the site give her the personal experience she’s used to and looking for? These are all things for the bakery’s UX designer to consider when taking a critical look at prototypes. 

## **Prototyping and testing** 

You’ve read about designers creating prototypes so people can experience what the product will look and feel like. If you think that sounds like testing, the next phase of the design thinking process, then you’re right: prototyping and testing are deeply interconnected. In the next reading, you’ll see how these phases work in tandem. Keep exploring to find out what happens next!

## **Key takeaways**

Design thinking has five phases: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test. It is a cyclical and iterative process that requires UX designers to revisit the different phases as needed. In the prototype phase, UX designers will create a model of the product. To do this, they’ll use various practices such as:

- Information architecture
    
- Sitemaps
    
- Wireframing (paper and digital)
    
- Lo-fi prototypes
    
- Hi-fi prototypes 
    

The goal of prototyping is to have a model to test and gain feedback on. The prototyping and testing phases of design thinking work in tandem.

# Phase 5: Test solutions

Once designers have built a prototype, it’s time to test it. **Testing** is the fifth phase of the design thinking process. And, as you’ve already learned, testing often happens in cycles with prototyping. 

![rocess flow that represents the design thinking framework: 1. Empathize, 2. Define, 3. Ideate, 4. Prototype, and 5. Test](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/jn2nfeafSjGaP2kKBBVezg_2c9cfcafeb9f45b49c81e48e29643cf1_p9Mm7QRFPVWbgrcLCmUTac6OOFr6g78Vcc2LhGSw8YSno-kZ4oiUCURHur0KqOt003Dx0JyIzoP6iPnPkleP7O0URlK7bf1DhwkBytpWKxe9OcP-2cR68ih2q0K4dUmYy1II1gv3moGT7i-4Rbay1vU?expiry=1727913600000&hmac=1BjNqF53Wr6AyZcGHEtNj3uVtzrLPFecp7_pnYiQUyw)

Process flow that represents the design thinking framework: 1. Empathize, 2. Define, 3. Ideate, 4. Prototype, and 5. Test. Test is highlighted.

Think back to the bakery example from previous readings. The UX designer organized the content and visuals of the website with information architecture and a sitemap. Then, they went through iterations of wireframing, eventually creating a low-fidelity prototype and then a high-fidelity prototype.

At some point in the prototyping phase, designers typically start testing their prototypes and making improvements. Effective testing aims to reveal what users think, feel, and experience as they use a product, such as a website or an app. To get rich and unbiased results, good testing starts with a plan. Let’s briefly explore the key elements of UX testing by considering the who, what, when, where, why, and how of a testing plan:

**Who will participate in the tests?** Early on, designers might ask friends, colleagues, design partners, or other informal participants to test a product and offer feedback. Later on, ideal participants include real-life users who align with the project’s user personas.

**What types of tests will be conducted?** In upcoming courses, you’ll learn more about different types of UX research and UX tests, including the kinds of information they help designers collect.

**When and where will the tests be conducted?** Tests can be conducted in person or virtually, in a range of different environments or communication channels. It all depends: Good UX designers plan tests that achieve the best balance between their needs and their project’s business requirements.

**Why are the tests conducted?** UX tests are conducted for a range of reasons, but the core goal is always to understand users and improve their experiences. During the test phase of design thinking, some of the most common reasons for testing are to:

- **Validate ideas, information, or decisions** from other parts of the design thinking process, such as user information generated during the empathize phase or design decisions made during ideation. 
    
- **Uncover usability issues** to address with further iteration and prototyping. Users experience these issues as pain points that prevent them from using the product and achieving their goals with ease and enjoyment.
    

**How will participants engage with the prototype?** Here, a key consideration is whether the testing process itself is inclusive and accessible for all participants. As you’ll learn, effective testing incorporates assistive technologies and other inclusive elements to ensure all participants can engage fully.

**How will information be collected?** Designers use a range of methods to collect information from users, including observation and interviews. They may also be able to gather information from the prototype itself or the systems that participants use to interact with the prototype.

For the bakery, the UX designer tested a low-fidelity prototype and then a high-fidelity prototype with a range of users who aligned with the project’s key user personas, including Berta. Through user feedback, the designer discovered key ways to improve the website and better meet users’ needs. With some time and further iteration, the designer eventually created a successful design that met his client’s business requirements while also creating an easy and enjoyable experience for users. Now it’s time for some pastries!

## **Key takeaways**

In the test phase, the goal is to refine the prototype as designers gain insight into whether or not it solves the defined problem. Once the testing is done, the prototype will be finalized, and the prototype will move on to the developers, who will turn the design into the actual product.

## **Design sprints and the design thinking framework** 

You may have observed that the design thinking framework and design sprints are both organized into five similar phases, and they both promote collaboration, user-centered design, rapid prototyping, and iterative testing. However, there are some distinct differences.

## **The design thinking framework:**

- Is an overarching framework with five phases: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test
    
- Is an overall philosophy for approaching problem solving
    
- Spans the entire product development process and is open-ended
    
- Utilizes many different methods and tools
    

## **A design sprint is:**

- A time-bound process with five phases: Understand, Ideate, Decide, Prototype, and Test
    
- A specific implementation plan for solving a specific design challenge
    
- Strictly timebound from start to finish, typically spread over five full business days
    
- One method with a defined process 
    

## **Using design sprints to align to the** design thinking **framework** 

Design sprints are an efficient and effective way to keep aligned with the overall goals of the design thinking framework. Since a design sprint typically lasts five consecutive days, it compresses the design thinking process into a focused, intense period of ideation, prototyping, and testing.

Below are some examples of how design sprints can be used to accelerate specific design challenges throughout the design thinking framework.

## **Empathize**

During the empathize phase, the design thinking framework focuses on understanding the users and their needs. Design sprints can be deployed in this phase to quickly research user behaviors and preferences, conduct interviews with users, and analyze customer feedback to understand pain points and opportunities for improvement. 

## **Define**

Design sprints during the define phase might focus on refining the problem statement, aligning stakeholders, analyzing the user journey, and generating ideas that specifically address the pain points identified in the previous sprint. This focused approach helps lay the groundwork for the following phases of prototyping, testing, and implementation within the design thinking framework.

## **Ideate**

In the ideate phase, design sprints can be employed to rapidly generate and evaluate ideas. The time constraints and structured activities of the design sprint can help teams generate a large volume of ideas within a short timeframe.

## **Prototype**

The prototype phase is where design sprints find their strongest application. Design sprints excel in creating prototypes that can be tested and validated, and the design sprint approach allows teams to quickly translate ideas into a visual or interactive prototype that represents the potential solution.

## **Test**

Design sprints integrate seamlessly into this phase by providing a structure for conducting user testing sessions and collecting feedback on the prototypes developed during the sprint. The insights gained from testing inform further iteration and refinement.

## **Key takeaways**

UX designers play an active role in design sprints by bringing their user-centered perspectives to help sketch, wireframe, prototype, and test during the design process. In the end, this helps to create meaningful and usable experiences for the target audience. 

Congratulations on getting the hang of all things design sprints and how they fit into the overall design thinking framework! Use these resources as you continue to explore the phases and purpose of this key part of UX design work.

Every design sprint is an opportunity for the team to learn something new. Design sprints are especially useful for entry-level UX designers joining a design sprint for the first time. 

During a design sprint, the focus is on: 

- Understanding the design challenge 
    
- Ideating solutions 
    
- Deciding which solutions to build 
    
- Prototyping a few solutions 
    
- Testing those prototypes
    

Immediately following a design sprint, the team should hold a retrospective. A **retrospective** is a collaborative critique of the design sprint process. 

Collaborative critiques play an essential role throughout the Design Thinking process, particularly during the prototyping and testing phases. These critiques focus on improving the design solution itself, considering factors like usability, visuals, and alignment with user needs. 

A design sprint retrospective is also a feedback-oriented activity within the Design Thinking process, but it has a different goal. The goal of a design sprint retrospective is to make sure everyone who took part in the sprint has the chance to give feedback and think about opportunities for improving the process. 

The key questions to ask during a retrospective are: 

1. What went well? 
    
2. What can be improved? 
    

Answering these questions will help the individuals and the team work better. It is important for everyone to feel empowered to share their experiences and to know that personal identifiers, like race or gender, don’t prevent members from being honest. Before a retrospective begins, remember that any feedback provided will be used to reflect on the experience and improve the process for the next sprint. 

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/pnxwdnubTKi0ppiGh4UNrQ_0c5b6971df094e5caaef048f60312cf1_wEaULThhZSvnvbVmqiMGtU7f4llC4eTWPR62jWzbeV9lNNJTLU4NPGnJThxQMRhgeq3Vx-saC4b5gZPNZrup-TEr6qNolxmLTJ8wLxYPoUSrAbxm2U0wFj9-q2_B-LBwArup7gisFEIacmm6xH9S94s?expiry=1728000000000&hmac=e5YlMGx1GOoiZRYLWEre630medNR2jG5rZc4PxPsRZQ)

## **What went well?**

Retrospectives usually start with discussion on the parts of the design sprint that were successful and areas in which the team did well. Maybe a new process was created that could be applied to future sprints. Or maybe the addition of a new digital tool enhanced the team’s productivity. Analyze the team’s wins, and think about how they could be applied to future sprints.

Questions a UX designer might ask during this part of the retrospective include:

- Which tools saved me the most time and effort?
    
- When did I feel the most satisfaction?
    
- What helped me make my best contribution to the team during this sprint?
    

This is also a good time to acknowledge a team member’s strong performance. Celebrating successes builds relationships and increases cohesion and harmony within the team.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/OAGohNNWS5axw72UrO9khA_ccd21b9c0b46473286632c90ca6c18f1_t4L5Yun4rrppwGXUTRTSEbCw87nzbHm1UTAyBa0XLjcuquvzzY_41fWL_pJiafpIvXqszjI3eEAlm4UsJVdhroIKdM1S0qHQ9GNA2ar8hXIRJ_ZXGgzg9b9AHpP2hGBaQvAkJwyLKuSapOBNxLaHE_Y?expiry=1728000000000&hmac=HYM-nUJpOwxM3mv3EpntLLaQdJJJ9MVZ7E6N7CAjsP4)

## **What can be improved?**

After highlighting everything that went well, it’s time to shift gears and think about areas for improvement. The team will want to know what went wrong, so that everyone can do better next time. 

Retrospectives are opportunities to encourage everyone to participate in sharing areas for improvement. Each individual might even take turns going around a circle and adding challenges to a shared list. If anyone is nervous about speaking up, each person can be invited to write their thoughts anonymously. Then, all of the improvements can be reviewed together. 

This process eliminates concerns about causing offense and reduces the chance of groupthink. **Groupthink** can occur in a group discussion when one person shares an opinion and everyone immediately agrees with the opinion, instead of sharing their own feelings about a topic. Groupthink prevents each person from having an equal say, and it might mean certain areas for improvement are overlooked.

Consider each phase of the design sprint to structure the feedback: understand, ideate, decide, prototype, and test. At what point were there missteps? What caused those challenges? Share individual perspectives if a phase or two didn’t go according to plan. 

Questions a UX designer might ask during this part of the retrospective include:

- What went wrong that caught me off guard?
    
- Which problems came up the most often?
    
- When do I think we experienced the biggest challenge as a team?
    

Then, a designer examines the sprint’s outcome or final product, and ask questions like:

- Did the team overestimate or underestimate the work required to complete the design?
    
- Did an external factor derail my productivity?
    
- Most importantly, does the final design actually solve the user problem?
    

Identify ways that the team could have ended up with a better solution. 

Keep in mind, retrospectives are about empowering—not shaming. This is not the time to call out an individual for poor performance. If there are issues with a team member’s work, it’s best to address it with that person privately, not during a team-wide retrospective.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/N6Lib73qQm6Hqr3KikyEQA_6d8d00ad47ac4787ac5ff9b2c5b46bf1_nGbV1P80f9NK2wj0rY6K7X3L77YowWO5OS-qKpRIGYDv7lqCBFDzjwmNJe6wmphc8z919t1Eec8ufrwB0q_h8fOWWU_oP6amobszXBH6vfOiBNYQ7AV2xD2zUI4y9WTCls7GQbBFFypXHB1Gh1QYmHY?expiry=1728000000000&hmac=g9f5wRrmh6QnqoSanaR12XJesFv0VrYSPkOMf81MGJ4)

## **Lessons learned**

By the end of the retrospective meeting, the team will have a better understanding of what went well and what could be improved. Naturally, they’ll want to take lessons learned into their next design sprint. 

Before the next sprint, the team reviews the conclusions reached at the end of the last retrospective. The conclusions should inform how they conduct the next sprint. Perhaps they need to include a more diverse team, allow more time for ideating, or test with additional users before moving forward with a design.

Questions a UX designer might ask include:

- What did I discover during the sprint that I’m still wondering about?
    
- How could the current process be holding the team back from creating better solutions?
    

## **Key takeaways**

Remember: In Design Thinking, collaboration and feedback during a retrospective are crucial for refining and improving designs. In a retrospective, a UX designer should be sure to speak up and share suggestions for how the next design sprint could be better. They should not be afraid to suggest anything they think will improve the project or next sprint. The only bad suggestion is the one not shared.

# Integrating research into the design process

You have been introduced to user experience (UX) design, and you’ve gotten to know the tools, common terms, frameworks, process, and goals of design sprints. Now, let’s start to explore the world of UX research. 

UX research is an important part of the design thinking framework—particularly when it comes to the empathize and define phases. The first rule of UX design is that the user comes first, so it makes sense to perform research and learn as much as possible about user behaviors, needs, and motivations in order to inform early design decisions. 

Take the development of a ride-sharing app as an example. During the empathize phase, UX designers can conduct interviews with potential users to understand their pain points and needs related to transportation. This feedback helps the design team to empathize with users and identify their expectations and challenges when it comes to finding, using, and paying for transportation.

Later, in the define phase, designers can gather user feedback through surveys or focus groups. This data helps the team prioritize the key features and functionalities that should be included in the app. This data also helps set clear design goals based on user needs to clearly articulate the main challenge to be addressed. For example, the transportation app design team might define goals such as, “Create a user-friendly app that offers a wide range of transportation options, ensures transparent pricing, and provides a seamless payment experience.”

UX research activities can continue throughout the entire design process. User feedback, user testing, and validation of design decisions against user needs are all valuable data points occurring at every phase of the design thinking framework. For example, during the prototype phase, UX designers create interactive prototypes of the ride-sharing app based on the validated design ideas. These prototypes are then tested with potential users who provide feedback on the app's flow, layout, and interactions, ensuring that it aligns with their needs.

As you dive deeper into UX Research in this certificate, remember that it's your job to put the user front and center in everything you do as a UX designer. Throughout this certificate, you'll explore the role of research in each part of the design process to help you empathize with users. You'll also learn about the benefits and drawbacks of common UX research methods. Finally, you'll identify and account for biases that can arise when conducting research.

# Learn more about UX research

There are two key parts to every UX design project: conducting research to learn about the users you’re designing for, and gathering feedback about their perspectives. UX design is all about putting the user first, and research helps designers understand those users. 

**UX research** focuses on understanding user behaviors, needs, and motivations through observation and feedback. Your product design should be built upon research and facts, not assumptions. UX research aligns what you, as the designer, _think_ the user needs with what the user _actually_ needs. 

Remember the product development life cycle from an earlier course of the program? The **product development life cycle** has five stages — brainstorm, define, design, test, and launch — that take an idea for an app, website, or product to its launch. 

Let’s check out how research fits into the product development life cycle.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/vN99Cj3JTPOffQo9yZzzTA_a8ace7f1875543ad853b4dea6b11ecf1_Graphic-updates-31-.png?expiry=1728086400000&hmac=PyKH06-JVgH_m6-awB_Aws_87mwSakY7jHJJTyD24jY)

![icon of a person holding a magnifying glass; text reads: foundational research](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/AIDZP6njSG6A2T-p40hucA_82a365d3d0844e7db5a38828962813a6_Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-8.20.58-AM.png?expiry=1728086400000&hmac=flXIF1dYug50WHmfXzF0s7id1Pvv9IddOOvxD10V9f8)

**Foundational research** is always done _before_ you start designing. Within the product development life cycle, foundational research happens during the brainstorm stage (stage one) to help you empathize with users, understand their needs, and inspire new design directions. During this stage, you will also make personas and user stories, which you'll learn about soon. 

In foundational research, your goal is to figure out what the user needs and how to address those needs with your product. Strong foundational research can contradict your personal perspective on what a good solution might be. 

Questions you might consider during foundational research include:

- What should we build?
    
- What are the user’s problems?
    
- How can we solve those problems?
    
- Am I aware of my own biases, and am I able to filter them as I do research?
    

There are lots of research methods for conducting foundational research, but many of them are based on observations. Common foundational research methods include: 

- **Interviews:** A research method used to collect in-depth information on people's opinions, thoughts, experiences, and feelings. You’ll often conduct interviews of your target users themselves.
    
- **Surveys:** An activity where many people are asked the same questions in order to understand what most people think about a product.
    
- **Focus groups:** A small group of people whose reactions are studied. For example, your focus group might bring together eight users to discuss their perspectives about new features in your design. A focus group is usually run by a moderator who guides the group on a certain topic of conversation. 
    
- **Competitive audit:** An overview of your competitors’ strengths and weaknesses. You'll conduct your own competitive audit later in the course, so you will understand this research method well! 
    
- **Field studies:** Research activities that take place in the user's context or personal environment, rather than in an office or lab. 
    
- **Diary studies:** A research method used to collect qualitative data about user behaviors, activities, and experiences over time. Often, a user will log, or diary, about their daily activities and provide information about their behaviors and needs, which can help inform your designs. 
    

![icon of a profile of a head with tools and icons coming out of the top; text reads: design research](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/5AkUuwpGQTaJFLsKRuE2uA_8a46fd7110f249969431abb764570737_Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-8.21.34-AM.png?expiry=1728086400000&hmac=MZ0l01pbCt8nlVv2_mKXXU_UDZBZVnmAbypj09HMxoE)

**Design research** is done _while_ you design. Within the product development lifecycle, design research happens during the design stage (stage three) to help inform your designs, to fit the needs of users, and to reduce risk. Each time you create a new version of your design, new research should be done to evaluate what works well and what needs to be changed. 

In design research, your goal is to answer the question: How should we build it?

The amount of design research you conduct will vary depending on where you work and what you’re building. The most common method used to conduct design research is a **usability study**, which is a technique to evaluate a product by testing it on users. The goal of usability studies is to identify pain points that the user experiences with your prototypes, so the issues can be fixed before the product launches. You’ll conduct your own usability study in the next course of this certificate program. 

Additional research methods that might be used to conduct design research include:

- **A/B testing**: A research method that evaluates and compares two different aspects of a product to discover which of them is most effective. For example, you might have users evaluate two layouts for the homepage of your app to find out which layout is more effective. 
    
- **Cafe or guerrilla studies:** A research method where user feedback is gathered by taking a design or prototype into the public domain and asking passersby for their thoughts. For example, you might sit in a local coffee shop and ask customers if they would be willing to test your app design for a couple of minutes and provide feedback. 
    
- **Card sorting:** A research method that instructs study participants to sort individual labels written on notecards into categories that make sense to them. This type of research is largely used to figure out the information architecture of your project, which we’ll discuss in the next course of the program — Course 3: Build Wireframes and Low-Fidelity Designs.
    
- **Intercepts:** A research method that gathers on-site feedback from users as they engage in the activities being researched. Intercepts are often conducted in the field, so this type of research is often considered a subset of field research. An intercept study can provide quick, high-level feedback.
    

![icon of a rocket ship in front of a laptop screen; text reads: post-launch research](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/AKOy2owtT-CjstqMLZ_gcA_b96ebe081b454789ba1ad41cb062cf27_Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-8.21.43-AM.png?expiry=1728086400000&hmac=qOzFp8PrezEXRWAD8Bnw6igGCieMQMWHKg3q82Jri1c)

**Post-launch research** is done _after_ the design is complete and your product has launched. Within the product development life cycle, post-launch research happens after the launch stage (stage five) to help validate that the product is meeting user needs through established metrics.

In post-launch research, your goal is to answer the question: Did we succeed? This research will tell you how your final product is performing based on established metrics, such as adoption, usage, user satisfaction, and more. 

You should use research methods that give insight into what the user thinks of your product and if their experience using your product aligns with how you intended it to function. Research methods you might use to conduct post-launch research include:

- **A/B testing**
    
- **Usability studies**
    
- **Surveys**
    
- **Logs analysis:** A research method used to evaluate recordings of users while they interact with your design, tools, etc. 
    

## The key to a user-focused product: Research

Research is crucial to creating a product that satisfies users. As an entry-level designer, it might be tempting to assume what the user needs based on your own experience, but as you know: The user comes first. Always make sure that your opinions are backed up by your research. You should get feedback from your users before, during, and after you design!


# Learn more about research methods

Understanding your users is one of the most essential parts of UX design. You’ve already learned about the problems that can come up when designers make assumptions about their users and their needs. So how do you avoid making those assumptions? By doing research! In this reading, you’ll explore some common research methods used by UX designers.

## Types of research

There are two ways to categorize research: _who conducts_ the research and the _type of data_ collected.

The first way to categorize research is based on who conducts the research: primary research and secondary research.

**Primary research** is research _you_ conduct yourself. Information from direct interactions with users, like interviews, surveys, or usability studies, are considered primary research.

**Secondary research** is research that uses information _someone else_ has put together. For example, using information from sources like books, articles, or journals is considered secondary research.

The second way to categorize research is based on the type of data collected: qualitative or quantitative.

**Qualitative research** is primarily collected _through observations and conversations_. Qualitative research is based on understanding users’ needs and aims to answer questions like “why” or “how did this happen?”

**Quantitative research** focuses on data that can be _gathered by counting or measuring_. Quantitative research is based on numerical data that’s often collected from large-scale surveys. This type of research aims to answer questions like “how many?” and “how much?”

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/UyvGxpRQQ2KrxsaUUKNibw_67212be7f5e24e8a84dddbc48850d8f1_Screenshot-2021-06-22-1.48.09-PM.png?expiry=1728086400000&hmac=yN-_68vDqRsu27-ys_9ePiP_30O4i-3go9VKq1cksHE)

All four of these types of research can intermix. Primary and secondary research can be both qualitative and quantitative. For example, an interview is _qualitative_ research. An interview conducted by you is _primary_ research. If you review an article about an interview conducted by someone else, it’s _secondary_ research. It’s important to be able to identify the difference between these types of research because the data you collect forms the basis of your design decisions.

## Primary research methods

Now that you understand the different types of research, let’s review some common primary research methods for gathering information.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/Sg6hUi0QT_SOoVItEG_0sw_1dbcf31c5c4644cbaf2efd161384baf1_Graphic-updates-23-.png?expiry=1728086400000&hmac=h9v6OfgK0FucBTv8AmeLlECf5XhgEcRS9x7YNPXmlc0)

**Interviews** are a research method used to collect in-depth information on people's opinions, thoughts, experiences, and feelings. Interviews can be performed one-on-one or in a group setting, like a focus group. 

Interviews can take the form of qualitative and quantitative research. A qualitative research method includes open-ended questions that require participants to explain their answers by providing more details. A quantitative research method includes only close-ended questions, like questions that require only “yes”  or “no” responses or set multiple choice questions.

Best practice is to conduct at least five user interviews during your research. As you conduct your interviews, you’ll start to find similarities in the feedback that users provide about what works and what doesn’t work about your product. This is exactly the kind of feedback you want! 

### Advantages

- You’re better able to understand what a user thinks and why.
    
- You can adjust your questions or refocus the discussion based on the user’s answers.
    
- You have the ability to ask follow-up questions in real time.
    
- You have the ability to ask questions specific to a user’s needs.
    
- You’ll receive direct suggestions from the user. 
    

### Disadvantages

- It’s time-consuming to interview each user. 
    
- It’s expensive to pay participants and to rent space for the interviews.
    
- The sample sizes are smaller, due to time and money constraints.
    
- Group interviews can be affected by the bandwagon effect, or going along with the group’s opinion instead of thinking creatively, which can discourage open discussion by people who have an opinion that doesn’t align with the majority of the group.

A **survey** is an activity where many people are asked the same questions in order to understand what most people think about a product. Surveys are a great way to measure the success of your product, during development and after it’s launched. For example, sending surveys after a product is released can help you measure the effectiveness of your product and provide a foundation for future improvements. 

You can design surveys to include open-ended questions for qualitative research, which allow research participants to clarify their survey responses, as well as close-ended questions for quantitative research, which generate numerical data.

### Advantages

- You can learn more from a larger sample size.
    
- You are able to gather results and insights quickly. 
    
- Surveys are usually inexpensive because they don’t take as much time for participants to complete, and they can be done remotely. 
    

### Disadvantages

- Surveys often do not allow for in-depth feedback; most questions will have responses drawn from a set of multiple-choice answers. 
    
- There are some types of research questions that won’t work in a survey format.
    
- Surveys usually do not allow for personalization.

A **usability study** is a technique used to evaluate a product by testing it on users. Usability studies help demonstrate if a product is on the right track or if the design needs to be adjusted. There are lots of ways to test usability, both in person and online. It’s a good idea to record your usability sessions, either audio or video, so you can reference the user data as you make design decisions later on in the process. 

Qualitative research is based on observations, and a critical part of conducting usability studies is observing how participants interact with the product you’ve designed. Focusing on qualitative research during usability studies can generate more personal insights by assessing the behavior of users as they experience the product. Quantitative research can also be used when conducting usability studies to understand participants’ impressions of the product.

### Advantages 

- You can learn from first-hand user interaction and observation. 
    
- Usability studies can challenge your assumptions about your product by demonstrating a completely different result than you were expecting. 
    
- Users can provide in-depth feedback. 
    

### Disadvantages

- Usability studies only measures how easy it is to use a product.
    

- This type of research can be expensive, especially if it’s conducted in person. 
    
- There can be differences between a “controlled” usability study in a lab versus how a user experiences the product in their real life.

## Secondary research methods

Secondary research can be completed at any phase of the project, since you’re using information from outside sources. In other words, secondary research is not a direct result of your product or the user you’re designing for. The information you discover during secondary research might lay a foundation for your primary research, so you have a better idea of where to focus your efforts. Or, secondary research might supplement the findings from your primary research for a project, to reiterate or strengthen your conclusions.

### Advantages

- Secondary research is generally cheaper and faster than primary research. This means you’ll save time and money. 
    
- You can often find secondary research via online searches and subscription research publications.
    
- Secondary research can be a good supplement to findings from your primary research.
    

### Disadvantages

- You will not learn from any first-hand user interaction.
    
- You will not receive user feedback specific to your product.
    
- Secondary research can be misleading and generalizing if not done appropriately.

# Learn more about bias in UX research

The human brain is an incredible processing machine, and it can store an amazing amount of information. One way brains are able to store so much information is by creating mental shortcuts based on repeated patterns. These shortcuts allow humans to relate and group information together for quicker processing. But, these repeated patterns of thinking can lead to inaccurate or unreasonable conclusions that are **biased** — favoring or having prejudice against someone or something. Biases can seriously impact your user research and negatively influence the design of your final product. So, let’s explore how bias can affect your work as a UX designer and how to combat it during your research.

## Preventing bias in data collection

It’s important to note that everyone has biases. It’s just a natural part of being human. Being able to recognize your own biases and prevent them from affecting your work is what really matters. As a UX designer, you’ll need to know how to anticipate, identify, and overcome biases in your research, in particular.

![icon of a hand, finger pressing a button; text reads: choose your words carefully](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/VuR1MH4fQvakdTB-H6L2Yw_c6a0d099db354167bce5ecbdf133dddf_Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-8.48.32-AM.png?expiry=1728086400000&hmac=RN1lBVzjjBZd24d1Qqli9jvqjCYEnglYANE-4w4sAp4)

**Choose your words carefully**. While conducting research, it’s important to use words that don’t lead the user in one direction or another. Of course, as a designer, you’re going to be partial to the designs you’ve created, and you’ll likely assume that users will appreciate them too. That’s why you designed them! But when asking users questions about their experience using your product, you don’t want them to answer in a particular way just to please you. Choosing leading words can cause the **framing effect**, where users make a decision or choice based on the way information was presented to them. 

This is especially critical in usability studies. For example, imagine a participant is testing your designs. You ask the participant: “Do you like or dislike the improved layout of these buttons?” Because you used the word “improved,” the user will most likely reply positively. But, this isn’t very useful feedback because you framed the question in a way that led the participant to respond accordingly. To improve your product, you need _honest_ feedback.

Instead, a better way to frame the same question is: “Explain how you feel about the layout of the buttons.” This phrasing allows the user to come to their own conclusions without any outside influence, which will give you better data about their thought process and experience. 

![icon of 3 paper airplanes; text reads: foster independent thinking](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/i0AUGVD2SqeAFBlQ9nqnuw_dd96a9d18d984b68a27b3aa84e2d0ec1_Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-8.48.44-AM.png?expiry=1728086400000&hmac=r6TBCJMbvMYzDBhl66At5YawyUbTdXk5lNPq4gUUtWE)

**Foster independent thinking**. Group interviews can be affected by the **bandwagon effect**, or going along with the group’s opinion instead of thinking creatively, which can discourage open discussion by people who have an opinion that doesn’t align with the majority of the group. 

For example, imagine you’re conducting research with a group of five participants. You ask each person in the group to share their thoughts one at a time about a particular product design choice, like the placement of a button on the home page. By the time the last person shares their thoughts, their feedback will be affected by all of the answers that were shared before them. To combat the bandwagon effect, ask participants to write down or record their thoughts before discussing as a group.

![Icon of a magnifying glass magnifying a paper; text reads: avoid specific language](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/pXLyH8wFRcSy8h_MBSXEPQ_19da55c5d79641a28ad9c461210a9cb0_Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-8.48.57-AM.png?expiry=1728086400000&hmac=ChNEOl8hhf5Y24jtDcefXfYoAVAIyL1A8HBlMlKcbNo)

**Avoid specific language**. It’s important to be mindful about the types of questions you ask users and how those questions are framed. You’ll need to be careful to avoid **confirmation bias,** which is trying to find evidence to prove a hypothesis you already have. 

Confirmation bias is particularly prevalent in online surveys. For example, imagine that you’re conducting an online survey with a large group of participants. One of your survey questions is: “How do you use our product?” As the designer, you have a few ideas about how you _think_ people use your product, so you provide four options with specifically worded language that the participant has to choose from. If none of the options you’ve provided apply to the user, they can’t select “other” or skip the question, so they’ll be forced to choose one of the multiple-choice answers that doesn’t match their actual experience. That means you’ll end up with false information that skews your research data and potentially provides incorrect evidence for a hypothesis you already had. 

Remember, in a survey, you want measurable results, which is known as quantitative data. You can reframe the question in your survey to ask participants to rate their experiences using the product, which will be a more accurate way to gauge how they felt about using it.

![icon of a funnel; text reads: limit the guidance you give users.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/XXR75_SxRNu0e-f0sQTb6g_f7156520c6fe49b09d0fc678cf1713c8_Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-8.50.36-AM.png?expiry=1728086400000&hmac=Gqd5jHizT0rpICSiw1L7s-uUK8NOhzapk450DQEbjWk)

**Limit the guidance you give users**. Everyone learns and thinks in different ways. When you’re conducting any type of UX research, you have to be cautious to avoid experiencing any **false consensus**, which is the assumption that others will think the same way as you do. 

If you’re conducting a usability study, some of the participants will not follow the product’s user flow in the way that you might expect. For example, a user might click through the menu, select a folder, and then select a subfolder to complete a task you assigned them, when there’s actually a simple hyperlink on the homepage that could have saved them time. In addition, some participants may use assistive technology to navigate the product and might follow an entirely different flow. 

It’s important to let participants follow their own paths through your product, without interrupting them. Interrupting a participant while they’re experiencing your product will deprive you of useful data that can help you understand how to improve your designs. Instead, ask participants to narrate or break down their user journey with your product, as they move through the flow. This will allow you to better understand their thought process as they navigate through your designs. 

![icon of a facial profile, with sound coming out of mouth; text reads: consider users' tone and body language](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/y5TZ0iEtSyyU2dIhLbssSQ_7fb9097bce93433581df810f335f64e8_Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-8.50.47-AM.png?expiry=1728086400000&hmac=aruPnSUn4gpjTM0mBFm9beMHhUhf2PIhoRcX_rouA1E)

**Consider users’ tone and body language**. You’ll work with many different users and participants throughout your UX career, and part of your job will involve interpreting their nonverbal cues, like vocal tone and body language. To avoid experiencing **implicit biases**, which are based on the collection of attitudes and stereotypes you associate with people without your conscious knowledge**,** it’s important to clarify when you think you’re getting mixed signals from a participant. 

For example, imagine you’re conducting a one-on-one interview, and the participant has their arms crossed over their chest. This can be interpreted as a sign of feeling defensive or insecure, which might contradict the positive feedback they are sharing verbally about your product. This is a great time to ask the participant questions, like “Is any of this making you uncomfortable?”, which can encourage them to explain that it’s cold in your office and they’re just trying to warm themselves up. Always ask questions if you’re unsure about the intention of a user’s tone or body language! 

For this feedback process to work, however, it’s important to make sure participants are comfortable sharing their thoughts with you. Before the research begins, ask participants about themselves or make light conversation. Starting with easier questions can help reduce anxiety or awkwardness throughout the study. 

![Icon of a person shrugging; text reads: be careful of your own body language and reactions](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/l5yTU9cvR9eck1PXL8fXlw_8b1fc2eaffad426fa92c428455e22458_Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-8.50.56-AM.png?expiry=1728086400000&hmac=XY1nBPWsQVWs1wZgDLl7jiZrMP4OyPLafDho1d-V8LQ)

**Be careful of your own body language and reactions**. You also have to be mindful of your _own_ tone and body language while interacting with participants. **Social desirability bias** can happen when a participant answers a question based on what they _think_ you want to hear. If you ask a question to a participant, and they notice you exhibiting a visual or audible clue that suggests your own opinion about the question, they might answer in a way that they think will please you. 

For example, imagine you’re describing a feature of the app you’ve designed that really excites you, and your tone of voice changes. If this happens, it’s likely that the participant won’t be honest about their negative opinions of the feature, since you’re so positive about it. If you want the data you collect to be useful, the user has to feel comfortable sharing their true, unfiltered feelings about the product. It’s your job to guide them through the process without accidentally influencing their answers. One way to do this is to reassure participants that their answers won’t hurt anyone’s feelings and that you really want to hear their honest opinions in order to improve your work. 

![icon of a magnifying glass with a check mark in it; text reads: plan your research effectively](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/Fc4RaC2uTYOOEWgtrt2D0w_2aab4ecec29d44e29035cc60f7702639_Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-8.54.25-AM.png?expiry=1728086400000&hmac=SyOCxF3F9FaLmdyo8I195Er3PIFU85i7SRyvekR_iM8)

**Plan your research effectively**. Tight deadlines are inevitable. But as a UX designer, it’s essential you get enough time to recruit the right users for your research. **Availability bias** occurs when you rush the user recruitment process or skip screener questions to attract a bigger pool of users, even if they don’t fit the qualifications or characteristics that you’ve already determined are present in your ideal user. 

The research that you collect is vital to your product design process. So interviewing users that don’t fall under your personas won’t give you the data you need to improve your designs. If you’re having trouble recruiting the right users before your deadline, offer a better incentive for participating in your study, adjust your recruitment strategy, or ask your project manager for more time. Don’t just take any user who’s available. 

![Icon of a profile silhouette of a face, text reads: remain open minded](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/jdC7NydCQfCQuzcnQrHwdQ_97a94e1f6e0e4709841ea04a36bd9503_Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-8.54.34-AM.png?expiry=1728086400000&hmac=u2sMsAJEr_rzA32BUEq8gZjAih-5qI-MS_oXlv4ZoS8)

**Remain open minded**. One more tip: When you’re conducting research, you have to work hard to treat all information equally to avoid both **primacy bias,** which is remembering the first user more than others, and **recency bias**, which is most easily remembering the last thing you heard. To help combat these biases in your own research, it’s helpful to space out the scheduling of interviews, ask your colleagues to join you during interviews to provide additional opinions, and take careful notes. 

## Combating bias as a UX designer

Although having biases is normal, it’s essential to try to eliminate bias from your research process to get the most accurate understanding of your users’ needs. Knowing the types of biases that exist and how you can avoid them will help you recognize when it’s happening, so you’re already off to a great start!

![Activity Introduction with a lightbulb icon](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/U4EJPjViT3iBCT41Yr94MQ_8360883201974fa6aeb0269209e35101_Screen-Shot-2021-03-08-at-5.13.58-PM.png?expiry=1728086400000&hmac=0jBmO0st3Oce9z5AbnJaT6BlxZk5ddVI3t2tQmyqyQI)

Everyone has implicit biases. When conducting UX research, it’s important to understand the biases that may affect that research. Recognizing implicit, or unconscious, biases is difficult because they are assumptions people have about other people that they may not be fully aware of.

One tool that can help you identify and explore your own implicit biases is the Implicit Association Test (IAT), created by researchers at Harvard University. In this test you will explore one way of thinking about biases that can help you be more inclusive as you develop your skills in design-thinking. The IAT uses data collected by each individual who takes the test to try to understand bias from a larger societal view. It should be used in conjunction with other strategies to help you build a foundation for understanding and recognizing bias. 

The IAT is not intended to be an exhaustive assessment of bias, but it can provide valuable insights that can help you better serve all users.

![Step-by-step instructions with a clipboard icon](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/gKjo03XdQuOo6NN13dLjMQ_4c48329d55b7408d826be3a842cfb6b6_Screen-Shot-2021-03-08-at-5.14.37-PM.png?expiry=1728086400000&hmac=l5HBl-D5mihvRTY0Ep7z9fMNvjK6GORhkZJT2WNgnGc)

Project Implicit® from Harvard University offers Implicit Association Tests on 15 different topics. Follow the steps below to explore the IAT options:

1. Read the [preliminary information](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html) on Project Implicit’s page.
    
2. Click **I wish to proceed** at the bottom of the screen.
    
3. Complete at least one of the IATs to pass this activity. Note: You can take as many IATs as you would like. Taking multiple IATs can help you be aware of different implicit biases. 
    

It is highly likely that after completing one of the IATs, you will be surprised by something your test results revealed about your biases. How can you use these new insights into your own biases to improve your approach to UX research so that it is more inclusive?

Although learning about ourselves in this way can be difficult, and sometimes make us feel defensive at first, it’s important to value identifying personal biases. Knowledge of our personal biases will help us become stronger UX designers.

# Welcome to Course 2

![Welcome to Course 2: Start the UX Design Process: Empathize, Define, Ideate](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/DuytesT_SNqsrXrE_xjaKg_dd46cc8ed8674949aa601e1430bc01c5_Screen-Shot-2021-03-10-at-4.23.03-AM.png?expiry=1728172800000&hmac=MrPw6wU6aW6agQgTz9AwxBsW37TFEp6C-E2pDH9UaWI)

Welcome to Start the UX Design Process: Empathize, Define, Ideate, which is the second of seven courses in the Google UX Design Certificate. Your journey towards a career as a UX designer continues!

In this course, you will complete the first phases of the design process for a project that you’ll be able to include in your portfolio. In the previous course, you learned about the design thinking framework (empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test). As you progress through this course, you can think of the design thinking framework as a structured step-by-step system for learning the design process.

In this course, you will learn how to empathize with users and understand their pain points, define user needs using problem statements, and come up with lots of ideas for solutions to those user problems. You will complete hands-on activities focused on designing a mobile app, which align with real tasks that UX designers complete on-the-job during these phases of the design process.

Content and projects in each course of this certificate program build on information practiced in earlier courses. To be successful in this course, you should complete the previous course of the certificate program, if you haven't already done so.

Each course of the Google UX Design Certificate is broken into modules. You can complete courses at your own pace, but the module breakdowns are designed to help you finish the program in about six months total.

So, what design skills can you expect to develop during this course? Here’s a preview of the hands-on activities you'll complete.

**Module 1: Empathizing with users and defining pain points.** Begin the design process for a mobile app! This part of the course will focus on understanding users, which is the first phase of the design process. You’ll empathize with fictional users to build empathy maps and create personas. These hands-on activities will help you understand user perspectives and pain points.

**Module 2: Creating user stories and user journey maps.** You'll continue to empathize with users of the mobile app you'll later design. You'll craft user stories and develop user journey maps. You’ll also learn about the importance of considering accessibility when empathizing with users.

**Module 3: Defining user problems.** All of your work to empathize with users will help you define the problem that users are facing. In this part of the course, you'll move from the empathize phase into the define phase of the design process. To define the problem your designs will solve, you’ll build a problem statement, a hypothesis statement, and a value proposition. In addition, you’ll explore how psychology and human factors influence design.

**Module 4: Ideating design solutions.** Move into the third phase of the design process: ideate. You'll consider everything you've learned about the users you're designing for and the problems they're facing in order to brainstorm ideas for design solutions. To help you come up with lots of ideas for design solutions, you’ll conduct a competitive audit and complete design activities, like How Might We and Rapid Sketching.

Keep in mind that if you want to obtain the Google UX Design Certificate, you must complete all graded materials in all courses of the certificate program and earn a score of 80% or higher. Graded materials are located at the end of each module and are indicated with the name "module challenge."

Good luck beginning the design process for your first portfolio project: designing a mobile app!

## Healthy habits for course completion

Here is a list of best practices that will help you successfully complete the courses in the program: 

- **Plan your time:** Setting regular study times and following them each week can help you make learning a part of your routine. Use a calendar or timetable to create a schedule, and list what you plan to do each day in order to set achievable goals. Find a space that allows you to focus when you review the videos and readings, and complete course activities.
    
- **Work at your own pace:** Everyone learns differently, so this program has been designed to let you work at your own pace. Although your personalized deadlines start when you enroll, feel free to progress through the program at the speed that works best for you. There is no penalty for late assignments; to earn your certificate, all you have to do is complete all of the work. You can extend your deadlines at any time by going to **Overview** in the navigation panel and selecting **Switch Sessions**. If you have already missed previous deadlines, click **Reset my deadlines** instead.
    
- **Be curious:** If you find an idea that gets you excited, act on it! Ask questions, search for more details online, explore the links that interest you, and take notes on your discoveries. The steps you take to support your learning will advance your knowledge, create more opportunities for you in this high-growth field, and help you qualify for jobs.
    
- **Take notes:** Notes will help you remember information in the future, especially as you’re preparing to enter a new job field. In addition, taking notes is an effective way to make connections between topics and gain a better understanding of those topics.
    
- **Review exemplars:** Exemplars are completed assignments that fully meet an activity's criteria; many activities in this program have exemplars that you can compare to your own work. Although there are often many different ways to complete an assignment, exemplars offer you guidance and inspiration about how to complete the activity.
    
- **Chat (responsibly) with other learners:** If you have a question, chances are, you’re not alone. Use the discussion forum to ask for help from other learners taking this program. You can also visit Coursera’s [Global Online Community](https://coursera.community/). Other important things to know while learning with others can be found in the [Coursera Honor Code](https://www.coursera.support/s/article/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code) and [Code of Conduct](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/208280036-Coursera-Code-of-Conduct). 
    
- **Update your profile:** Consider [updating your profile](https://www.coursera.org/account/profile) on Coursera to include your photo, career goals, and more. When other learners find you in the discussion forums, they can click on your name to access your profile and get to know you better.

# Choose your portfolio prompt

As you’ve learned, your first portfolio project will focus on designing a mobile app to meet the specific need of a hypothetical business or organization. Later in the certificate, you’ll use the same prompt to create a responsive website. Now it’s time to select your project prompt!

Before selecting a prompt, take time to explore your options. Review the list below and use the Sharpen prompt generator in the next course item. In both the list and the prompt generator, all the prompts are similar to those you may encounter in job interviews. For some interviews, potential employers may assign UX design prompts to get to know your work. Like those interview exercises, the prompts in both the list and the generator will tell you the kind of product you’re designing (an app), the business or organization to design for, and the overarching need the product should fulfill. 

Use the following guidelines when reviewing and selecting your prompt:

**First, consider which prompts spark your interest and imagination.** Select one that you think will sustain your creative energy over the next five courses in the program. Have fun!

**Second, consider your experience level:** 

- If you are new to UX design or just want more support as you complete your first design project in the certificate, we strongly recommend selecting a prompt from the list. These prompts have been curated to closely align with the design prompt examples that are discussed throughout the certificate. To explore those design prompt examples before you choose a prompt of your own, check out the **Portfolio project prompts** below.
    
- If you’re more experienced with UX design or just want more of a challenge, consider selecting a prompt from the generator. The generator provides a greater variety of more diverse prompts to stretch designers’ skills.
    

**Third, remember to record your prompt.** Save a screenshot of it, write it down, or use some other method. This is especially important if you use the Sharpen prompt generator in the next course item. If you generate a prompt you like, the Sharpen tool will not save it for you, and you may not be able to generate it again—so be sure to record it.

## **Sharpen generator for additional project prompts**

Once you’ve reviewed the portfolio project prompts below, you can explore the Sharpen prompt generator in the next course item for more inspiration. To produce a prompt, click on the “New Challenge” button. You can refresh the prompt as many times as you want to find one that sparks your creative energy. Remember that the generator provides a greater variety of more diverse prompts to stretch designers’ skills. It’s a good place to look for a prompt if you have some experience with UX design and want more of a challenge.
